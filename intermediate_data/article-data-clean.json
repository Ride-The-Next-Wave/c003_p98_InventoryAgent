Max Miller knew the risk was great – but the reward greater. So he poured himself into this project and surrendered to the scars and sleepless nights he would earn along the way. Why? Because in his mind’s eye he could see that, despite the sacrifice… past the pain and the eminent agitation – in the end – there would be SERENITY. And there IS.

        "content": "Photo Epic: 2025 McGazza Fest Dream Jam: MCGAZZA DREAM JAM 2025 Words and Photography // Riley McLay One of the hallmark events of the New Zealand summer has arrived, the McGazza Dream Jam. The highly anticipated event draws not only local riders but also a wave of overseas athletes who call Queenstown home during the off-season. It’s a continued celebration of Kelly McGarry’s enduring legacy that has inspired many riders of all ages to ride more and push their own progression. The idea of the McGazza Festival as a whole is to live a weekend like Kelly lived his life. Ride what he liked to ride, listen to the music he liked, and make the most of every moment just like he did. Whether you know of Kelly or not, the weekend gives riders the platform to elevate their skills and to learn from some of the best riders in the world while still keeping to Kelly’s relaxed outlook on life. The McGazza Dream Jam is a showcase of the culture that Kelly embodied and inspired. This year’s addition of an under 19’s category to open for the main event allowed the highly talented and up-and-coming groms to showcase what the future holds for the sport. The crowd was also treated to a star-studded main event with the likes of Jackson Goldstone, Laurie Greenland, and Asa Vermette. Not to mention, Kiwi free-riders Conor Mcfarlane and Robin Goomes were also throwing down. Next year marks 10 years since Kelly’s passing, and event organizers are already gearing up for a big one! A full trip down memory lane to showcase why Kelly is still such a special part of this community. Mcgazza Forever! Kelly still really inspires me. His attitude toward life and his willingness to help others and have the best time doing it makes me want to keep running this event for as long as possible. — Emmerson Wilken Celebrating the legacy of Kelly McGarry. Inspiring to see the next generation following in Kelly's legacy. Noah Evens boosting to the moon! Camden Rutherfurd showing that he is one of the most stylish up-and-coming riders. While having as much fun in the process. Imagine growing up with Dream Track in your backyard. Local ripper Reece Everett is no stranger to Dream Track. Throwing huge whips at only 14 years old. Watch the space, the groms are coming! A quick refresh before the adult's session. Jim Monro firing out of the gate. Jacob O'Donoghue-Price floating over the line up of riders. Tyler Brooker shining in all white. Asa Vermette in the house. Robin Goomes' huge backflip had the crowd on their feet. Conor Macfarlane with a head-turning dumped 360. You just can't teach style. Asa in full control. Rudi Eichhorn with one of the biggest backflips of the night. Gareth Burgess likes what he sees. Billy Spurway's trademark steeze. No complaints here. Flame on! Fritz fulling dumped, followed this up with a backflip Superman! Win some, lose most. Ollie Clements took a set of heavy bails throughout the night but kept getting back up and into his work. A quick Red Bull sales meeting as Asa and Jackson wait for their next run. Big ups to the Queenstown Mountain Bike Club and the Kelly Mcgarry Foundation for always putting on such a dialled event. Volunteers always bring the stoke. Plent of mouths to feed. Laurie Greenland with a steezy one-footer. Vinny Armstrong is very much a crowd favourite. There is always a chainsaw. Big smiles all round. Conor leading out the final McGazza train to end the night. McGazza Forever."

        "content": "BC Bike Race Introduces New eMTB Categories For 2025 Event: Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. “This has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don’t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it’s time to start including them in our event.” — Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn’t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. More About the eBCBR: Date: June 30 – July 6th, 2025 Location: Vancouver Island – British Columbia Stage 1 – Victoria Stage 2 – Victoria Stage 3 – Cowichan Valley Stage 4 – Nanaimo Stage 5 – Cumberland Stage 6 – Campbell River Stage 7 – Cumberland BC Bike Race website Photo Credits : Dave Silver"

Prevost DH Combine Invitational: Thank you to Stevie Smith Foundation, Municipality of North Cowichan, All-In Paramedic Services, all the pro riders, Aedan Skinner, Natalie Carrier, Oakley Salvisburg and all our volunteer course marshalls, and shuttle drivers for supporting the event and making it a success. Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada’s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year’s participants were 13 of BC’s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost “Race Trail” Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next year! — Mark Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique event. — Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada. We strive to empower our team members by instilling values of perseverance, resilience, dedication, and self-respect, to not only excel in racing but also in life.

Tasmania aka Tassie, is Australia’s only island state and this rugged little island is filled with lush, dense forest and its reputation as a mountain biking hotspot has exploded over recent years, luring riders from all over the world. Maydena Bike Park is a gravity park with over 800m of elevation (most of any bike park in Australia) that officially opened in January 2018. It's located in Tasmania’s scenic Derwent Valley - an easy 1 hour and a 15-minute drive from Hobart CBD, or a 1 hour and 30-minute drive from Hobart airport. Jackson Goldstone giving The Local his signature 'tap' of approval. The Local is just one of close to 100 individual trails at Maydena Bike Park. It combines dense temperate rainforest vibes with epic, perfectly groomed jumps, rollers, and berms. Located on the lower slopes of the bike park, The Local can be accessed via a wide variety of technical, flow, or jump trails. There are two different uplift services, a fast turn around Lower Mountain ATV shuttle, and the Full Mountain shuttle bus service, taking in every metre of the parks immense 820m vertical elevation range... (be right back, going to look at flights). The park is closed during the [Southern Hemisphere's] Winter months and usually opens near the end of September. Long-travel trail bikes or DH rigs are recommended - there is a bike rental shop at the base if you don't want to travel with your own rig, along with a cafe & beer garden so you can have a break, grab a coffee, or chat over a beer and good food after a day of riding. Despite being the home of Red Bull Hardline in Australia, and having hosted multiple world-level gravity events, Maydena Bike Park also has one of Australia’s biggest networks of beginner-friendly flow trails - check out some of their recommendations . The Dirt Art team worked their magic to design and craft this place into a MTB Mecca and are well-known for their sustainable trail design methodologies, and construction. It’s not just flow and jump trails here, half the trails at Maydena are natural, hand built tech trails and each one is unique, making the options endless with each lap. The Local is a jump trail with pretty much everything including hips both ways, nice and wide and when dry it would run prime and even let you slow down a bit so you can get more pop. - Mitch (hardinggrim) It's safe to say that Tassie is that like that quiet friend who lets everyone else brag, but deep down, it’s holding some of the best trails, the kind you’ll never stop thinking about."

        "content": "First Ride: Curious Creatures' Offbeat & Comfortable Apparel: Mountain bike apparel takes itself a bit too seriously at times, with graphics and technical details that can have you looking like you're lining up for a Supercross race while you're casually pedaling to the top of a hill. That look might not be for everyone, and as a result we're seeing more brands offer lower-key alternatives for riding kit. Curious Creatures fits that bill well, with simple designs for women and men focused on comfort and utility. All the fabrics mentioned here are Bluesign approved, and Curious Creatures offers a repair service through a Montana-based sewing studio for any damage that may occur through use. Sun Dog Shorts Details • Knit waistband w/ drawstring • 12.5\" inseam • 2 zip pockets, 1 snap pocket • 100% polyester body, spandex waist • 2 colors • Sizes: Men's 28-40 • Price: $180 USD • wearecuriouscreatures.com The Sun Dog shorts are very lightweight, with a stretchy and breathable fabric body that feels ideal for hotter temps. Their knit waistband is one of the more unique elements, with no closure to speak of aside from the internal drawstring to tighten things up. The women's version, known as the Bitterroot , employs a similar design, but with a taller waistband cuff and a different pocket layout. Those are available in 2 colors, and standard sizes from 0 to 20. Sun Dog Pants Details • Knit waistband w/ drawstring • 31\" inseam • 2 zip pockets, 1 snap pocket • 100% polyester body, spandex waist • 3 colors • Overlapping ankle cuff with snap adjustment • Sizes: Men's 28-40 • Price: $180 USD • wearecuriouscreatures.com Much like the shorts version, the Sun Dog Pants are lightweight and breathable, but the 31\" inseam goes most of the way to a shoe, depending on how lanky you are. They employ a unique adjustment at the ankle, with two snaps to allow for a tighter or looser fit per your preference. The overall fit plays well with kneepads, thanks to a cut that isn't skin tight per size. The women's Sun Dog Pant comes with a taller waistband, a 29.5\" inseam, and is offered in 5 colors. Sizes range from 0 to 18, with the same dual snap lower cuff adjustment. Ramble Scramble Shorts Details • Shank button w/ internal drawstring • 7\" or 11.5\" inseam • 7 pockets, 1 with zipper • 100% polyester w/ stretch • 3 colors • Sizes: Men's 28-40 • Price: $139 USD • wearecuriouscreatures.com The Ramble Scramble shorts are more standard issue than the Sun Dog, with a heavier weight fabric, standard closure, and two inseam options. They feature two hand pockets, two back pockets, two thigh pockets (one with a zipper), and the little coin pocket you never know what to do with. The Women's version features the 7\" inseam only, but does come in 6 different colors, and sizes from 0 to 20. The pocket layout is the same, as is the fabric weight. Ride Impressions I've been riding and lounging in these three items for a few months now, with conditions spanning the gamut from summer highs to winter's deepest depths. I have a size 32 in all three items, and though I typically wear a 31/32, I'd probably opt for a 33 for the Curious Creatures fit. The waist is a little tighter than other 32s I have, but more importantly the front of the pants & shorts fit more like a women's cut, with less room for the male anatomy. On the bike this isn't an issue, but they can feel a little snug if you're trying to bridge the shorts into a more casual setting. Performance-wise, I'm really impressed with the fabric Curious Creatures has developed. For riding in hot weather, the Bird Dog pants and shorts feel perfectly suited, venting heat and moisture without issue. The knit waistband is a novel and well-designed feature as well, staying comfortable over very long days in the saddle, and never developing any pinch points or rubbing. The Ramble Scramble shorts have a massive amount of stretch to them, defying expectation for what otherwise looks like a standard 5-pocket short. The longer of the two inseam options will probably be the choice for those looking to wear them with kneepads, as the 7\" inseam provides quite the gaper gap. That said, the 7\" sans pads is a pretty ideal summer move, if you're willing to let the thighs shine and risk the skinned knee. Though I can't personally attest for the fit or function, the Curious Creatures women's lineup looks like one of the more well-considered on the market. The fit and function are designed for women first, as opposed to a reworking of the men's lineup. There are some additional items to the women's catalog that don't feature on the men's side, so head over to the Curious Creatures website to dig in. I'm working on a long-winded apparel mega review, with deeper comparison between a variety of items, so stay tuned for that to see how the Curious Creatures kit stacks up against the field."

With Elliott now on the Foes, Ant Hale on the Static, and Nigel and young local ripper Fransady Keita on the Evil rigs. The trail fairies have been hard at work on Flat White, it is incredible now so thank you very much for the graft.

And yes, he is going on I'm a Celeb next year, or so I heard anyway. This was also the first ride for Ant Hale on his new Static eBike and it's great to see another UK brand giving it a go. Alongside those two, Nige brought out Fransady, a very stylish young rider with big potential on the Evil.. I haven't seen a table clicked like his in a good while. Big up 50to01 for sorting all the lads out with some top tier riding gear. Hope you enjoy some classic Golfie ripping. Cheers to Abus for supporting the project."

        "content": "Race Report: New Zealand’s 2025 Enduro MTB National Championships: Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year’s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape. The reins for the National Championships, however, will be passed on to whom we have yet to find out! Photo credit thanks to Digby Shaw & Rory Stock"

        "content": "Race Report: Crankworx Rotorua Ends with a Bang After New Courses & New Challenges: Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women’s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan’s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. “This course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today”, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Košárková grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Košárková defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Košárková’s podium spot. Women’s Top 5: 1. Caroline Buchanan (AUS) 2. Jordy Scott (USA) 3. Sabina Košárková (CZE) 4. Natasha Miller (CAN) 5. Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist’s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men’s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2. Sam Blenkinsop (NZL) 3. Richie Rude (USA) 4. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (NZL) 5. Tegan Cruz (CAN) Full results here . With Rotorua kicking off the 2025 Specialized Dual Slalom Series, riders will now shift their focus to three more thrilling stops: • Specialized Dual Slalom Cairns (May 21-25) • Dual Slalom SilverStar (August 1-4) • Specialized Dual Slalom Whistler (August 8-17) King & Queen of Crankworx Standings Update As the festival concluded, the battle for the 2025 King & Queen of Crankworx titles took shape. Ryan Gilchrist’s win propelled him to the top of the standings with two former Kings of Crankworx on ranks 2 and 3. Jenna Hastings currently leads the women’s field, followed by Jordy Scott, and Sabina Košárková. Men’s Leaderboard: 1. Ryan Gilchrist – 414 pts 2. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene – 339 pts 3.

        "content": "Transition Presents Blue Ribbon Trail Located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, Washington: We are proud to present \"Blue Ribbon\", a public trail located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, WA. This project is the culmination of years of permitting work, hours of machine time, and finished off by selfless volunteer work. Watch the video above to learn about how it came to be, and come visit us in Bellingham to catch a lap down this mind bending trail! Step 1: All trails require one thing, a corridor. To establish ours for this project we worked with local trail advocacy group, the WMBC, to obtain permits and find a window of time for construction. All said and done, this took nearly four years from when we kicked off the project proposal to when we broke ground. During that time we walked the proposed zone, looking for the right grade to create the flow we were after. With the planning and layout completed, the trail building mastermind, Nico Vink, arrived to start breaking ground. Step 2: Realize it's too much work for one person and call your friends. We quickly realized it would be too much work for Nico so we called in TR GiddyUp ambassadors Teddy Jaramillo and Henry Lanman. They run a trail building operation in New Mexico, and were the perfect people to get on the job. Nico had always wanted to work with a crew of three and this project lined up perfect for that. Henry ran the big excavator clearing corridor and mining dirt while Teddy followed creating general shapes for Nico to finish and fine tune in his machine. Step 3: Dig 'till you can't dig anymore, then dig a little more. Nico, Henry and Ted were able to work for a solid month of spring, 2023, before the dirt became too dry to continue shaping. Nico then returned to Belgium to ride his bike and process the work he had already completed on Blue Ribbon. Giving him a summer to visualize the flow he had in mind for the trail. With some refreshed energy, he returned to Bellingham that Fall to complete the machine work on the trail. Countless days ensued with the help of WMBC's Ryan Joslyn to create the final shapes that you can ride on Blue Ribbon today. Step 4: Find every available shovel and pair of hands to butter up the trail after the winter. With all the machine work in the past, it was time for us and the community to get our hands dirty and butter up the remaining bits of the trail. Nico had done almost 95% of the work with the machine, but a few transitions still needed some shaping. With the help of the community and a company dig day the trail took its final transformations and was ready to ride. Step 5: Open the trail to the world, and get some laps! After battling with some wacky Spring weather, we finally opened Blue Ribbon in June of 2024. Thanks to everyone who helped along the way and came out for the opening celebration. And a huge shout to Nico Vink for his relentless work and contributing to making this community better and better. This trail was a huge effort, and we are stoked to give it to the community. Hope to see you out there soon! You can find the trail HERE . Grab your friends and check it out this Fall!"

        "content": "Videos: Adventures In North Wales with Hâf Land & Fleur TK: Haf Land and Fleur TK's North Wales Adventure Video by Samantha Saskia Dugon Photos by Sophie Skelton I'm Hâf Land, and I ride for Starling Cycles. I joined the family just over a year ago as a racer, and for 2025 I'm mixing this up a bit. Rather than competing, I'm going to focus on some adventures - big rides, fun stuff, and making some content. I'm excited! To get started, Fleur and I caught up for a local adventure in North Wales. She's a fellow Starling rider and one you've probably seen here in this video . We met up with filmmaker Samantha Saskia Dugon and also Sophie Skelton, who was capturing the day in pictures. The plan was to head out for the day and explore some of my local trails around Llanberis, in North Wales. I moved back here from Scotland a little while ago and have been really loving getting to know the place again, and wanted to show Fleur round. It was the perfect opportunity to shoot a video. We met bright and early (10 am!) and everyone was just super friendly. We all just got on great from the word go, which was a great start. We started off at a café to grab some coffee from a lovely yellow shop on the high street that matched Fleur’s bike! No coffee for me though - I’m Gen Z, so I don’t need it, according to Fleur, who is a Millennial and drinks a flat white. We set off up the hill with big smiles on our faces and butterflies in my tummy because I didn’t want anything to go wrong! We had an amazing time shooting this little project, and it was so great to have an all-female creative team—so much stoke! Sam was incredible and so well-organised with her filming, making the day stress-free and fun for all of us. Sophie recently moved up to Mid Wales and came along to take photos as she is developing different skills and techniques to use in her photography. Seeing her and Sam bouncing ideas off one another was so cool. Fleur is always absolutely awesome and drove all the way from Scotland that same morning just to see me! We filmed the day over four separate tracks and did a lot of pushing up through brash, which was less fun. But we ended up with some awesome footage and newfound inspiration for riding again. 2024 was a funny one for me, I started out racing really well, but had a bad-luck accident where I dropped a bike on my head and struggled with a concussion for months. I found it hard to be excited or inspired about riding for so long - but this adventure really brought back my love for riding. I had the best day and felt so at ease in the company of these three amazing women. As I’m sure we will see in the video, Fleur and I had a few tumbles! It was mostly on the same section of track, straight into the bushes! By some power of the universe, despite the high ratio of crashing to not crashing, Fleur, myself, and our bikes came out unscathed, bar a few scratches and a lot of laughter! No broken brake levers, PHEW! The trails in the area, although not many in number, rate very highly in my books. With some amazing craftsmanship on display, it’s clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into these tracks, and we were so grateful to be given permission to film there. The scenery was incredible, and we got so incredibly lucky with the weather—it was dreamy! After a long day of filming and dilly-dallying, we were so ready for another café break before calling it a day. We headed to an amazing local spot at the end of the lake, which I had been hyping up all day. We were all so ready for some nice hot food and drove there, only to find out it was closed. DEVASTATING. By this point, we were hanging. We were out of snacks, and just about keeping our eyes open. We called it quits and headed back to the café we had visited in the morning. We had something to drink and some cake (as all the hot food had sold out), then made our way back to the car park. After a long day of grafting, with three out of four of us having long drives back to various parts of the UK, we called it a day and headed home. And what a day it was! I’m super grateful to have been given this opportunity. I hope you all enjoy watching it! Expect to see more of this soon! CREDITS: This project was produced by an all-female crew.

Originally scheduled for Sunday, the event was moved to this morning due to strong winds in the forecast. After extensive consultations and careful consideration of multiple scenarios, athletes unanimously opted for an electrifying new competition format: a high-stakes two-run elimination battle. This strategic shift not only raised the intensity but also gave all riders the opportunity to perform on the big stage of the SWC. For the men, the field was cut in half after Run 1, while the women’s competition saw the top five of eight riders advancing to a second round. Women’s Competition: A New Era Continues Now in only its second season within the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship, the women’s competition reinforced that these athletes are pushing the limits and proving they belong on the world’s biggest stage. Germany’s Patricia Druwen made a powerful comeback from illness, throwing down an incredible 87.75-point run filled with technical mastery and precision. Her trick list included an X-Up to Suicide No Hander, a Double Oppo Bar Spin, and a Backflip Tuck No Hander, solidifying her place as a serious title contender this season. Joining Druwen in the final five were Natasha Miller, Robin Goomes, Shealen Reno, and Zoe Witwicki. Meanwhile, Renata Wiese and Natalia Niedzwiedz, competing in their first-ever SWC event, struggled with speed on the course and were eliminated after Run 1. The final runs saw Zoe Witwicki better her score but fall short of catching 2023 SWC Champion Shealen Reno, finishing fourth after missing speed into the whale tail. Meanwhile, Druwen, Miller, and Goomes celebrated their podium positions with a stylish party train down the course. Women’s Results: 1. Patricia Druwen (GER) – 87.75 pts 2. Natasha Miller (CAN) – 80.50 pts 3. Robin Goomes (NZL) – 75.25 pts 4. Shealen Reno (USA) – 67.50 pts 5. Zoe Witwicki (CAN) – 61.25 pts 6.

Dropping in last, his 360 Double Tailwhip to Bar Spin, Double Backflip Tuck No Hander, and 360 Tuck No Hander In-Double Backflip Out solidified his spot at the top – an untouchable lead that no one could surpass in Run 2. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year, Kaidan Ingersoll (USA), proved his rising star status, bettering his score in Run 2 to secure silver with 90.87 points. Meanwhile, Canadian Ben Thompson, a last-minute entry after injuries in the field, made an immediate impact, earning bronze with an 82.92-point first run. The final round saw Paul Couderc, Griffin Paulson, Jake Atkinson, and Max Fredriksson advance, though Paulson, Atkinson, and Fredriksson all crashed on the final feature, much to the crowd’s amazement.

        "content": "The Man Behind the Berms: Kyle Strait on Crafting Sea Otter’s Dual Slalom: Words: Dan Hughes I get bored easily…as a human and as a rider. — Kyle Strait This sentiment, expressed by the man behind the dual slalom courses at the Life Time Sea Otter Classic presented by Continental, Kyle Strait, goes a long way to explaining the continued excitement and staying power of the discipline at Laguna Seca. From young racer to master builder, Strait’s cycling career has taken him around the globe, but always with a soft spot for Sea Otter. Originally from Southern California, Strait first encountered Sea Otter through the pages of mountain bike magazines. Inspired by what he saw, he asked his father if they could attend and, in 2000, got his first taste of the scale of a Sea Otter. You come up the hill to the guard shack and can see the whole place, the XC folks, the pits, and the hill where the dual slalom is…it’s huge. — Kyle Strait But the size of Sea Otter didn’t seem to deter Strait, and it didn’t take long for him to make his mark, winning the (adult) Pro Dirt Jumping competition at the age of 13. From there, Strait would become a fixture not only at Sea Otter but in the world of slopestyle riding, missing only two Sea Otters since 1999 (one when Sea Otter’s date was moved to the fall, and one when he was rehabbing a broken knee cap) and being the only rider invited to every edition of the Red Bull Rampage (and its first two-time champion). This connection to the sport is what helped Strait add course-building to his resume as a rider. After years of building tracks for himself and others, Strait got the call from Sea Otter to design the dual slalom courses in 2022. I had built lots of tracks as an amateur, but when I had the opportunity to carry on the legacy of Keith Defiebre (longtime Sea Otter dual slalom course designer) and work on the tracks at Laguna Seca, I, of course, said ‘yes.’ — Kyle Strait But the work on the hillside wasn’t straightforward, both in terms of soil and the task at hand: You’ve got four different kinds of dirt to deal with there, and the weather. It’s also one of the only sports you can do where professionals at a high level and amateurs use the same course. You’ve got to design a course that’s challenging and safe for every rider. — Kyle Strait Strait’s process for course building is a time-intensive process. Starting 21 days out, he and his team build features from scratch with an eye towards accommodating riders of every stripe and incorporating features from favourite tracks around the world. For a pro, I might build three rollers that they can triple, but an amateur can roll, and I also want to take care of the adaptive racers, making sure the track is at least 39” wide. Sometimes, I think ‘that section from CrankWorx was awesome, let’s do that. — Kyle Strait And then comes the testing, which Strait does himself, although he has to employ a few tricks to approximate the feel for each rider group. I try to give myself as many handicaps as possible when I do the testing to get a sense of what it’ll feel like for a first-time rider. I’ll do the whole course seated, or with no brakes, or with my hands reversed to make sure it’s rideable for everyone. — Kyle Strait On race day, upwards of 600 athletes put the course through its paces with multiple practice runs, qualifiers, and the finals. Winners are crowned, and Strait takes photos to document the courses before they’re wiped away for another year. It’s a county park, so we return it to its natural state. That means we have to start from scratch at every Sea Otter, which is a challenge, but we craft unique courses every year and get different winners as well. If the 2024 course wasn’t what you like in dual slalom, then you’ll probably love the 2025 course. — Kyle Strait In the end, Strait’s stewardship of the dual slalom event is about more than just one rider’s love of the sport; it’s a confirmation of the sport’s place in a score of riders’ histories. I remember sitting in the back of my dad’s truck, trying to warm up from the freezing rain, competing against riders years older than me in the 18-and-under category [in 2000]. Sea Otter has kept three generations of dual slalom riders going. I’m proud to be part of that. — Kyle Strait"

        "content": "Interview: Cam McCaul Talks Natural Selection Bike Event: INTERVIEW Cam McCaul On Natural Selection Bike Words by Stephane Pelletier / Photos: Izzy Lidsky, Tyler Roemer Cam McCaul is a true legend of the sport. A rider who inspired thousands with his riding and energy, he continues to shape the sport as a pro rider, commentator, and all-around personality. Most recently, Cam's been deep in the development of Natural Selection Bike, Todd Barber's brainchild, and a real evolution from the Proving Grounds and Rampage formats we're used to. I got the chance to sit down with Cam and chat about Natural Selection, how it all came together, where it's headed, and what everyone can look forward to in tomorrow's broadcast. The live broadcast of NST Bike kicks off March 5th at 12 PM PST. In the meantime, enjoy Cam! Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. Natural Selection has been a groundbreaking event in snowboarding—how did the idea of bringing it to mountain biking first come about Cam McCaul: Todd Barber started “Proving Grounds,” which had the original mission of creating an event that could fill the gap between slopestyle and Rampage. In a nutshell, Proving Grounds caught the attention of Natural Selection as they were exploring the idea of expanding into other sports. If you think about it, there’s a common motivation there. NST was started by Travis Rice, looking to fill a gap in competitive snowboarding. Todd was doing a similar thing with mountain biking, and those paths converged. To be honest, I think NST is a great direction forward for all four sports that are involved (snowboarding, ski, surf, MTB), and I’m just so excited that mountain biking gets to be a part of it. What was your role in helping make this event a reality? Cam McCaul: If you really believe in something and you want to see it come to life, you’re just down to get in wherever you fit in. I initially fit in as someone Todd could brainstorm his ideas with during the Proving Grounds days. That evolved into wandering around the woods with Todd, Carson Storch, and Kyle Jameson trying to envision course designs for the original Proving Grounds in Prineville, Oregon, then I was creating content to promote that event, then I was test-riding some features, then I was the “Athlete Liaison” to kind of be the conduit between the athletes and the event crew, then I was the announcer for the event, then the host of the broadcast once it got to that stage, etc. Now that Proving Grounds has evolved into Natural Selection Bike, I’m working with the NST team in a lot of different ways to ensure we’re staying true to our sport, creating something that fills a void, helping with athlete selections, running the @naturalselectionbike Instagram account under the guidance of our NST social whizzes, announcing the event on-site, and I’ll be in the studio for the broadcast coming up March 5. How did you and the rest of the team go about choosing New Zealand as the location for the first-ever Natural Selection MTB event? Cam McCaul: New Zealand is not only full of great terrain and natural beauty but Queenstown, in particular, is also kind of THE SPOT for mountain biking during our northern hemisphere winters. I wasn’t on the scout trip when they chose the location, but if you watch the documentary “Search for Natural Selection Bike,” you can see how many different potential venues they explored before finally finding the right one. They seriously left no stone unturned in the search. It’s insane how dialled the venue at Mt. Dewar is for this event, first and foremost for the terrain, the pitch, the quality of dirt, etc., but also because Queenstown feels like the MTB epicentre this time of year. Everywhere you look, there are iconic zones, and the majority of the best riders in the world are passing through all season. Plus, the locals are some of the best people ever in addition to being some of the best riders/builders in the world. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What were the biggest challenges in adapting the Natural Selection concept to mountain biking? Cam McCaul: Well, the best part is, that’s not really the objective… It’s not a mission to create a snowboarding contest on mountain bikes. The mission is to create something new, unique and true to OUR SPORT. Each sport NST gets involved with has the creative freedom to structure its events to fill a needed gap in that individual sport. Coincidentally (or not), what this ends up creating is something that runs parallel with the riding that the athletes do on their own time and in their video parts. What kind of riding style and athlete mindset does this format reward compared to traditional freeride or slopestyle events? Cam McCaul: I’d say it really rewards riders who spend less time on the airbags and more time on the trails. Yes, you need tricks to do well, but maintaining flow and remembering speeds in order to link together a great top-to-bottom run really ended up being the most valuable skill a rider could bring to this event. I had this realization halfway through the week while watching practice – The riders who end up on the podium will be the ones who nail the best one-take segment in their contest run. How much usable footage for a segment can you produce in your comp run…? You gotta rip the trail sections, roost the berms, pop the hips, trick the drops, trick the jumps. The riders who drop runs that could be a film segment…those are the riders who will score high and place well. Sensai for the new generation. The terrain looked absolutely insane—what were some of the key elements that made this course unique? Cam McCaul: The top and middle of the venue are where the natural terrain features are on display. Making those natural features rideable and linking them together with singletrack and bike-park flow sections was a task that the build team executed beautifully. At the bottom, it opens up into really big jumps. The combination of the top, the middle, and the bottom is what makes this event unique. Linking a clean run through the whole thing is no easy task. How did the riders respond to the course? Were there any surprises in how they approached it? Cam McCaul: The runs are long, and the features are big. The first course walk day, all the riders hiked around and realized that learning these lines would be something that would take time. Each rider approached practice differently and had their own process. One rider’s approach that was insanely impressive (but not really surprising because he has done this before) was Dylan Stark. Dylan just wastes no time… He gets straight to the top of the course and does a T to B. Even if there are features that haven’t been guinnea’d yet, he just drops in and links a run. Natural Selection in snowboarding has a distinct judging format—how did you translate that into mountain biking? Cam McCaul: It’s called CREDO, which stands for Creativity, Risk, Execution, Difficulty, and Overall Impression. In all contests, I have a firm belief that the overall impression should matter most. It’s a nice idea, but in a lot of cases, it falls apart because most events have pre-determined point deductions for things like slipped pedals, crashes, etc. At NST Bike, you can literally crash and get back up, and if the merit of the things that are done successfully is heavy enough, it’s possible to bank a respectable score to build upon. In this event, there are two different trails, and the men’s riders take one run on each. So the men have a combined score for the two different runs, with no throw-aways. This format really rewards consistency. Max score for run 1 is 50 points, max score for run 2 is 50 points. The highest combined score (out of a possible 100) after those two runs takes the cake. In the spirit of having the flexibility to make adjustments as needed to ensure things are done right, the decision was made by the Women’s field to adjust their format from 2 runs to 1. Social media guy. Were there any specific moments that stood out to you as defining what this event is all about? Cam MCCaul: Absolutely… Finley Kirschenmann and Janelle Soukup. The timing of their trajectories as riders and how that converged with this event taking shape is super special. They both earned their invites through the “Dream Ticket” qualifying event and then absolutely killed it in their final runs at Mt. Dewar. This event is probably more suited toward veteran riders with long histories in the sport because the venue and format are so demanding. Yet, these two have already racked up well-rounded backgrounds and diverse skill sets at a very young age, and they put it all on display with pressure. They really do represent an exciting glimpse into the future. Some of the best freeride events have a strong storytelling element—how did you want this event to stand out in terms of visuals and coverage? I think from a “storytelling” perspective, the story is simple. Create a couple of the most fun and challenging feature-filled trails on earth, get some of the best riders to take one run on each of the trails, shoot it like it’s a film segment, and whoever kills it the most wins the event. When you’re riding with your friends, you know who’s ripping the hardest. This is just like that but elevated. There will be less controversy from viewers because there are fewer “apples to oranges” comparisons going on, and it will be easier for recreational mountain bikers to relate and enjoy watching. It’s not an anomaly…It’s mountain biking…at a very high level, yes…but it looks like mountain biking. Another thought, if you were to have a group of 10 riders ride one berm or one jump and then rank them 1-10 in order of who rode it best, it would be hard. Maybe you could easily determine who got first and who got last, but figuring out who placed 4th – 8th would be insane. The fact that these lines at NST Queenstown are long, and you’re being judged on two runs, creates more room for separation. It creates room for the strongest riders to rise to the surface but also more room for differentiation in the middle of the pack. Checking out the NST Track. This event seems to bridge the gap between backcountry freeride and competition—do you think it represents a new path for mountain biking? Cam McCaul: This event is one iteration of the many different paths it can potentially take in the future. No one location or terrain type defines mountain biking or the “freeride” side of mountain biking. If an event series is going to truly represent freeride mountain biking, the event series needs to be as versatile as the sport itself and able to experiment and evolve. Instead of saying it represents a “new path” for mountain biking, I’d say it represents a whole new “trail network” of possibilities. Could you see Natural Selection growing into a multi-stop series like in snowboarding? If so, where would you love to see future events held? Cam McCaul: Heck yeah. I think each location that becomes home for future events will also dictate what type of format the event takes on, what riders get invited, etc. This Queenstown event is held on really challenging trails/jump lines, like Coronet Peak on steroids. Another event could be held in a desert zone with chutes, fade-aways, and cliff drops. There could be another event in the woods with wild freeride stunts connected by trail sections. Let your imagination run wild with the things that you love about mountain biking, and create a contest for it. That is what this is for. How do you think this format challenges riders differently than Rampage or the Fest Series? Cam McCaul: Rampage is a one-of-a-kind spectacle and is untouchable in terms of the box that it checks. Fest is a series of all-time jam sessions on huge jumps. Freeride can’t be put into a box, so it makes more sense to have a lot of different boxes and figure out the right ways to check them. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What impact do you think this event could have on the next generation of freeriders? Cam McCaul: Riders will develop really well-rounded skill sets. What’s something about organizing an event like this that people watching at home might not realize? Cam McCaul: Todd would be the right one to answer this in more detail, but from my perspective, it’s the village of passionate and dedicated people working around the clock to make wildly ambitious ideas possible. From Todd’s H5 Events to All Good Productions in NZ, to Rod Drury’s TRAC non-profit, the NZ Government’s tourism initiatives, the course builders at Elevate, the athlete advisory committee we have that consists of Cam Zink, Carson Storch, Casey Brown, and Emil Johansson, plus the whole crew I work with at Natural Selection who are simultaneously running events in 4 sports in the first 3 months of the year, it’s absolutely incredible what’s possible when you all feel like you’re doing it for the right reasons. I don’t think it’s possible to understand how much is going on behind the scenes until you get a peek behind the curtain. Were there any “oh sh*t” moments during planning where you thought something might not come together? Cam McCaul: For me, the biggest “oh shit” is realizing how many qualified athletes there are in our scene right now but how few spots there were on the invite list. That was the hardest part for me to be involved with. I’ve sworn I would never judge an event, but here I am on a panel of people who are selecting the invited riders, knowing that there are inevitably going to be so many I want there that won’t make it on the list. Being on a selection committee is almost worse than being a judge. Guess that’s what I get. If you could pick one rider from any era of MTB history to drop into this event, who would it be and why? Cam McCaul: Any era? Ok, Kirt Voreis circa 1999. Because he rules and always has. Some of the Natural Selection Bike Crew."

        "content": "Ready to Ride: Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand Kicks Off the 2025 Season: PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform Ōtautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand’s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival’s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill’s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Košárková from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand’s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on ‘home turf’ advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen’s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA’s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP’s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style. This event also marks the beginning of a strong partnership between Crankworx and Christchurch, highlighting the city’s potential as a world-class mountain biking destination. After a day of race action, athletes and spectators can cycle into town and enjoy dinner at The Terrace , where they will find some of the city's best restaurants and bars, set along the Ōtākaro/Avon River. With its colourful, Spanish Mission-style architecture, New Regent Street is a hot tip, boasting an abundance of places to eat and drink in an amazing setting. Riverside Market is another favourite spot, with options for all tastes and temptations.

        "content": "Bike Check: Lean Cycles P1 Prototype: BIKE CHECK Lean Cycles P1 Prototype Photography by TEBP In the beginning there was beer. Beer, bikes, two friends who were studying mechanical engineering and the will to design a bike unrestricted from commercial market demands. Robert and Luca were at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) when they had the idea to build a bike based on everything they had learned at university and their previous jobs. Luckily, their tutor was a bike nerd too and allowed Luca to make this bike his master's thesis. The Lean Cycles P1 prototype is a wild mix of 3D printed steel parts, machined aluminum, welding, brazing, a progressive high pivot suspension design and - last but not least - a belt-driven gearbox. Robert and Luca founded a small company which enabled them to apply for research funding from Innosuisse. Their friend Kilian joined them later in the process, so Lean Cycles is now a team of three friends. From the beginning, they always wanted to create a bike with a very light rear end to reduce the unsprung mass. At the same time, a high progression suspension design was on the list too, which was designed around a coil shock. Thanks to the massive uni-piece swingarm, they don't need a frame splitter to install the Gates belt. The geometry is full custom of course: - Reach: 480 mm - Stack: 635 mm - Wheelbase: 1272 mm - Seat angle: 77.5° - Head angle: 63° - Chain stays: 445 mm - BB height: 345 mm The goal was to push the boundaries of frame design to a new level using modern development and manufacturing processes, without being driven by commercial market demands. — Luca from Lean Cycles The tubing is Reynolds 931. Luca says that it's really good for joining processes and double butted. It's the same material as the 3D printed parts, which is needed to get the best results in his opinion. The machined swingarm is made from rather rare 2099 aluminum. Luca says that it contains quite a lot of copper and lithium, which makes it stiffer and even lighter than other aluminum alloys. It's so rare that he had to get some help from his tutor to source it. It's also around 10x more expensive than other alloys, so it wouldn't be a viable option for a serial production bike. As this was a master's thesis at a Swiss university, it wouldn't have been enough to \"just\" make a frame. Of course there had to be a very analytical part too. To learn more about the strength of the welded and brazed parts, they made some mockups and put these in test machines. After that, Luca and Robert cut the joints open and inspected them with a microscope. This gave them valuable insights for the the welding and brazing processes for the actual frame. To make sure the frame would survive proper enduro riding, they got in touch with testing lab EFBE from Germany, which provided the team with data from its downhill testing program. All the calculations and assumptions they made are based on the EFBE DH test. For the 3D printed parts, they used topology optimization and the inputs they got from EFBE. It was a long(ish) process, as they did the calculations for every single part first and after that for the whole frame. The swingarm was also designed using topology optimization, that's why it doesn't look symmetrical. When all the calculations were done, FHNW did the machining and a partner company in Switzerland printed the other parts. The frame wouldn't exist without Zurich framebuilding legend Wim Kolb, who helped them to weld and braze the frame and who also helped them a lot during the whole process. Brake levers from Oak Components. It's not often that you see a stem that matches the dropper post. Funding from Innosuisse allowed the Lean Cycles team to get some 3D printed parts from a Swiss company. The lug is brazed at the seat tube and welded at the top tube. Luca hopes that the small grooves in the 3D printed parts can help to reduce stress concentrations. As this was the first bike they ever built, they tested their suspension design with Lego models first. No frame splitter needed on this bike to install the belt drive. How progressive? Yes. What will the future hold for Lean Cycles? One thing is for sure: They won't sell this bike. Their main goal was to build their dream bike, to showcase their abilities and how modern technology can help to create outstanding bikes. Luca, Robert and Kilian from Lean Cycles would like to thank FHNW, Wim Kolb, Pinion, DT Swiss and Oak Components for their help."

        "content": "Dario DiGiulio's 2025 Predictions: Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again."

        "content": "Video: Adrien Loron Takes on Urban Riding in Barcelona in \"Salsa Brava\": Words: rideBiXS Barcelona has long been a hotspot for urban culture and street sports. Costa Brava serves as a mecca for BMX, inline skating, and scooters, while La Poma attracts dirt jumpers from around the globe during winter. Its unique urban architecture provides endless opportunities for creative riders. For Adrien Loron, Barcelona is more than just a destination—it’s a second home. Years ago, he and his friends would escape the cold by spending weeks riding the city. Now, Adrien spends half the year there, using the city’s countless staircases as his training ground for the Urban Downhill World Tour. This latest video project was a chance for Adrien to push his riding to the next level. His goal was to explore the urban environment in new ways, unlocking fresh lines and tackling unique spots. By switching between different bikes, he was able to make the most of each location and adapt to the challenges they presented. Years of exploring the city made scouting easier, but the project still demanded lots of creativity, precision, and courage. A wooden ramp, a couple of motivated friends, and a lot of determination were all it took to turn his ideas into reality. The pressure while riding these spots was real. In Cataluña, police patrols are constant, and riding in open public spaces isn’t always understood. You have to be quick—visualize the stunt, set up fast, and go. Sometimes, it’s a one-shot deal with no room for mistakes. Every spot has a story, and every shot feels like a victory. — Adrien Loron The project wasn’t without its challenges. Some of the wildest ideas didn’t pan out, but Adrien and his team still managed to capture unforgettable moments. This experience also deepened Adrien’s love for street riding, and he’s already planning more projects like this in the future. Special thanks to Adrien's friends, without whom the video project could not have been realized: Pipe Vergara | Mati Rojas | Vitor Buchli"

        "title": "Review: MET's New Revo MIPS Helmet",
        "author": "Jessie-May Morgan",

        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/review-met-revo-mips-helmet.html",
        "content": "Review: MET's New Revo MIPS Helmet: MET Helmets have announced an all-new open face helmet, the Revo MIPS. It replaces the Roam helmet with a construction that offers improved ventilation over that predecessor. Highlights on this one include the impressively deep coverage at the rear, a good range of adjustment, and the quiet two-piece MIPS Air Node Liner. The Air Node liner deals with the rotational forces in an impact, while the polycarbonate-covered EPS takes care of more direct forces. On top of the obligatory CE, AZ/NZS and US safety certifications required to sell the helmet in those respective regions, the MET Revo MIPS conforms to the more recently introduced NTA safety standard required for Speed Pedelec, or e-bikes that provide assistance up to 45 km/h. Another stamp of approval for this helmet comes from independent helmet testers, Virginia Tech; a 5-Star rating is the highest rating possible, indicating that of the hundreds of helmets vying for your money, this is one of the safer options. MET Revo MIPS Details • MIPS Air Node Rotational Impact Protection • Magnetic Fidlock Buckle • In-mold Construction • Single Density EPS • 4-position adjustable visor • Cradle height adjustment • 23 vents • Actual Weight: 368 grams (Size S) • Sizes: S (52-56cm), M (56-58cm), L (58-61cm) • Price: 200,00 € / £169.99 / $230 USD / $300 CAD • Certifications: EN1078:2012 + A1:2012 and NTA 8776:2016-12 • Virginia Tech Rating: 5 Star (Score: 10.45) • met-helmets.com It isn't obligatory for MTB helmets, but MET is one of a growing number of helmet manufacturers (Specialized, POC, Fox, etc.) that choose to go above and beyond on that front; the NTA tests subject the helmet to multiple impacts over a greater area on the helmet, a little deeper on the shell than the standard testing. The Revo MIPS is a 5-Star rated helmet, receiving a score of 10.45 from Virginia Tech. The lower the score, the safer the helmet. A score of 10.45 puts it at #38 in the rankings, as compared to the 7.23 score of the current #1 , the Fox Speedframe Pro RS . Granted, the Speedframe Pro RS is considerably more expensive at $279 USD. However, it is worth highlighting that there are twelve mountain bike helmets that have received a lower (safer) score from Virginia Tech that come with a smaller price tag than the Revo MIPS. Performance & Construction The MET Revo MIPS has an in-mold construction with a single-density EPS. The coverage is notably very deep at the rear providing a little more than the Rogue Core helmet from sister brand Bluegrass. There are 23 vents distributed around the polycarbonate shell with deep ventilation channels visible on the inside leading to large exhaust vents at the rear. I won’t comment too much on how well ventilated a helmet is owing to my having a lot of hair, but I can tell you that MET go to great lengths to objectively test how cool their helmets are. Their in-house testing includes use of a wind tunnel and a head dummy heated to 38°C. By measuring changes in temperature of the dummy, the design engineers can determine what combination of vents and airflow channels delivers the best cooling effect. Inside we have a MIPS Air Node Liner, the function of which is to reduce concussive rotational forces during an impact. There are a multitude of MIPS liners, some of which can creak as they rub against the EPS shell. Happily, this Air Node variation is very quiet. It's also one of the lightest options going, combining the air pockets of the MIPS system with the comfort liner itself. On the Revo, the Air Node Liner is a two-piece affair. Due to the deep coverage a second liner was required for the occipital portion of the shell to ensure that the rotational impact protection adequately extends to that rear portion. RETENTION & ADJUSTMENTS My head circumference is 54cm putting me in the middle of the range of the size small I tested. While its features offer a good range of usable adjustment, for me, this is not the most comfortable and well-fitting helmet. I experienced pressure points at each side toward the rear of my head. I think the shape of the venting channels in this area narrows the helmet a bit. I prefer the fit of the Bluegrass Rogue Core which gives an even pressure everywhere. While the pressure points are evident initially I will say they aren't so prominent that I’m aware of them while riding. The head belt is a full wrap on the Revo so it tightens evenly when you cinch it down. It tightens from the back though so the smaller you make it the further the shell's position will be biased toward the front of your head. The dial on the cradle is a decent size so not too fiddly to adjust. The occipital height adjustment doesn't run on a ratchet system which is absolutely a good thing. In my experience those can slip when trails get rough resulting in the helmet's position shifting while riding, or while putting goggles on, requiring constant re-adjustment. With the more basic poppet design like that seen here on the Revo the retention system stays put. The visor has four indexed positions owing to an attachment point at the center that runs on a ratchet. It is reasonably flexible, designed to breakaway on impact to reduce rotational forces. That said, the fact that it is secured by three attachments instead of two likely means more force would be required before it broke away from the helmet body. Extremes of the visor position. Note: The Revo MIPS has a good range of occipital height adjustment. Here, I have it positioned with a rearward bias. I found the middle position to give a better fit, rotating the shell forward a little to give more coverage at the front. At the other end of the range, the front of the shell basically sits on my eyebrows. The MET Revo does offer storage for sunglasses though how secure it is will depend on the sunglasses themselves. The glasses I tested the helmet with don't have rubber on the arms for extra security so the glasses will bounce around and run the risk of falling out when riding over bumps. I guess helmet manufacturers could take matters into their own hands by providing rubber inserts against the wall of the ventilation channels to better grip the arms of the glasses. Importantly, the arms are able to slot all the way into the vents without contacting my head. PRICE At $230 USD, the MET Revo is one of the more expensive MIPS-equipped helmets that money can buy. I will mention again that there are twelve more affordable helmets ranked by Virginia Tech that have been award a lower (safer) score - like the $110 USD Specialized Tactic (Score: 8.55) which to my mind is still one of the best value mountain bike helmets money can buy. WEIGHT Claimed weight for the MET Revo MIPS in a size small is 370g; ours weighed in at 368 grams. That's fairly middle of the road, and on a par with the more expensive Fox Speedframe RS, Virginia Tech's top ranked MTB helmet, which gets the more advanced MIPS Integra Split. It's not particularly light, but with the deep coverage this helmet offers I wouldn't really expect it to be. Pros + Design prioritizes ventilation + Good range of usable adjustments + Space for sunglasses storage + No creaking + 5-Star Rating from Virginia Tech Cons - I experienced pressure points - There are lots of less expensive helmets with a better safety rating from Virginia Tech Pinkbike's Take The MET Revo Mips is a quality open-face helmet with a design that prioritizes ventilation. While its shape isn't the most comfortable for my head shape, the retention system does offer a good range of adjustment for dialing in the fit, and the sunglasses storage is a nice feature. While I am sure it will be a solid option for many, for me there isn't anything particularly standout about the Revo. It will be hard to justify purchasing this helmet over less expensive options that have performed better in independent safety tests. — Jessie-May Morgan"

        "content": "First Ride: BikeYoke's 3D-Printed Sagma Saddle Lineup: Only a few years ago, 3D-printed saddles felt like some futuristic show of technological prowess, with little chance of becoming an attainable reality. Time has proven otherwise, as more and more companies now offer the technology at increasingly competitive costs. BikeYoke is the most recent addition to that list with their Sagma 3D lineup. Sagma Details • 3D-Printed TPU upper • Carbon, aluminum, or chromoly rails • 130 or 142mm width • Suspended \"regular\" or standard \"lite\" rails • Weight: 222g, 142mm Lite Carbon • Price: $159-249 USD / EUR • bikeyoke.com Like their more typical foam saddles, BikeYoke's Sagma 3D comes in a suspended rail version and a more typical fixed-position rail design. The suspended saddle has either aluminum or carbon rails, while the standard (AKA \"Lite\") saddle comes in carbon, aluminum, or chromoly. Like other 3D printed saddles out there, the idea behind the Sagma 3D is to more accurately tune the softness of the cushioning to suit different areas of the saddle. By changing the density of the printed matrix, they can meaningfully change the feel by zone. Pricing is a little higher than BikeYoke's standard saddles, but the costs aren't drastically different. Unsurprisingly, the suspension elements add some cost, as do the carbon rail options. As mentioned above, you can get the Sagma with their Rail Suspension Design concept, which uses elastomers at the front and back of the rails to isolate the rider from any harsh feedback. The saddles ship with three elastomer options, so you can tune the feel to suit your preference. There are two width options to choose from: 130mm and 142mm. Folks with wider sitbones will have to look elsewhere, as the Sagma errs on the narrower end of things. Ride Impressions I've only had a few rides on the Sagma so far, splitting time between the 130mm and 142mm width carbon-railed non-suspended versions to get a feel for the fit. The wider option feels more natural to me, and falls in line with my favorite saddles out there, like the WTB Silverado and the Specialized Power. Recommending a saddle is a tough game to play, as everyone is different enough to warrant a test before buying in. The overall shape of the Sagma is a little odd feeling to me, without much of a flat plane to settle onto over longer consistent pedals. There is a pocket of comfort, but so far I've found myself situating myself more often than usual to get things feeling right. I'll keep playing with the positioning of things and we'll see how it shakes out long term. I often find that printed saddles take some time to break in and soften up, but the Sagma has been fairly comfortable right out of the box. I'm curious to see if the feel changes over time, but will report back on that front."

Not only is he a kind man and a great rider, but he's been instrumental in bringing the TRP product to the point they've reached today. I was lucky enough to spend a few days riding with him just a few weeks ago, prior to the launch of their recent brake update. All that in mind, I'm saddened to report that he's had a horrible snowboard accident, leaving him with serious medical expenses and a life-changing injury. On March 7th, Kevin was wrapping up a perfect powder day when a devastating accident changed his life. A fall of over 10 feet onto an unmarked cat track left him with a burst fracture in his T12 vertebrae, resulting in a traumatic spinal cord injury. After enduring over 12 hours of surgery, Kevin is now in acute rehab, working to adjust to this new reality. At this time, he has no feeling or movement in his lower legs and feet and is learning how to navigate life with these challenges.

After another 92 kilometres of racing, the Toyota Specialized and the Scott-SRAM MTB Racing teams lead the overall standings. Annika Langvad and Sofia Gomez Villafane continued their dominant show of strength from the prologue stage as they finished the 92-kilometre stage by over five minutes. Finishing the day in second place, the Efficient Infiniti SCB SRAM team of Vera Looser and Alexis Skarda maintained a healthy lead over third place, with a gap of over two minutes to Rosa Van Doorn and Janina Wust. As the teams head into day three, the Toyota Specialized team lead the general classification by almost seven minutes, with another six minutes back to the third-placed team. Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo went one better on the first big day of racing as the Scott-SRAM MTB Racing teammates bested the prologue winners by 31 seconds. The Wilier-Vittoria team of Luca Braidot and Simone Avondetto couldn't match their prologue-winning pace on the longer stage one. Braidot and Avondetto still put in a great effort to only fall behind the stage one winners by 11 seconds in the overall race standings. Check out the results from stage one below. We will update this page with analysis and highlights from the second day of racing shortly. Stage 1 has a reputation for being a shot across the bows, a day which sees hopes dashed and protagonists for the week ahead stake their claims. 2025 will be no different, steep gradients are the order of the day which begins benignly enough before devolving into a brutal series of back-to-back climbs. There will be no strength in numbers or hiding in a group. It will be team vs team, mano a mano, across the cols of the Cape. — Cape Epic Full race replay: Stage Results: UCI Women Top 5: 1st.

Story of the Stage After close racing across the first four sectors of the stage one course, Annika Langvad and Sofia Gomez Villafane put the power down from sector five onwards, with their lead growing from four seconds after sector four to over three minutes following sector six. From here to the finish, they would not give up any time to the rest of the top ten teams as they extended their winning margin to over five minutes at the finish line. The UCI Men's racing remained close until the seventh sector, where only the prologue-winning team of Wilier-Vittoria could match the pace of the Scott-SRAM MTB Racing teammates Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo. As the race reached its conclusion, the prologue winners, Luca Braidot and Simone Avondetto, held the race lead by 10 seconds into the final part of the 92-kilometre course. A savage final attack from Schurter and Colombo saw them pull back 41 seconds to take the lead and the first stage win of the week. Sector Comparison for the Top 3 Finishers"

        "content": "Review: Khyber V1 Mulit-Pivot Bike Rack: If you’ve ever shuttled before, you know how taxing it can be on your bike and vehicle. Khyber Racks were designed specifically to transport bikes safely and securely offroad while withstanding the elements. They're built with a stainless-steel mast, baskets, and hardware, as well as thick aluminum brackets. The material specifications make their racks extremely rigid but also corrosion-resistant. Using the wheel basket design along with special rope tie-down, the only point of contact is the bike’s tires and rims. Khyber’s patent-pending Speed Lock system cinches down nearly any size wheel, which makes loading bikes fast and easy. These holds the bikes firmly in place while being spaced far enough apart that no handlebars or pedals can touch. Khyber Racks comes in two styles, a pivoting bracket or a fixed position. Otherwise, the V1 Multi-Pivot and V2 Fixed racks use the same construction and carrying method. V1 Multi-Pivot 5-Pack Details • Stainless steel and aluminum construction • Wheel basket design only contacts rims and tires • Patented Speed Lock tie-down ropes • Holds wheel diameters from 20\"-29\" • Fits tires as wide as 2.8\" • Two upright positions • Drop-down pivot (V1) • Lateral and Vertical anti-rattle pins incl. • Weight: 46 kg (101 lb) • Price: $1,490 USD / $2,100 CAD (5-bike) • More info: khyberracks.com Design and Features Khyber makes the V2 Fixed rack available with 2-7 baskets, while the V1 Multi-Pivot can carry 3-7 bikes. The V2 can be positioned in two different angles; vertical or forward (towards the vehicle). The V1 also has those two upright options, plus it can swing 35 degrees downward to access the vehicle’s cargo area. The wheel baskets are optimized for tires up to 2.8” wide and work best with 24-29” diameter wheels. Road and gravel bike wheels fit in the baskets, however, drop-bar bikes may cause handlebar interference*. Khyber states that in some cases the baskets can hold 20” wheels, but that may depend on the fork dimensions*. Fat bike baskets are available at an additional cost. Mitigating corrosion was Khyber’s first priority. As mentioned, the main mast, wheel baskets, lower wheel bar, and hardware are stainless steel. The 50 mm square tubing is also custom extruded at 8 mm, making it 25% thicker than standard ¼” tubing. *See Khyber Racks FAQ for more information. Khyber uses the same spigot, mast, and plates as the base for all racks. This allows for customization to upsize or downsize the number of bikes should you wish to change those components further down the road. The wheel basket bar and 12 mm thick connecting plates are made from 6061-T6 aluminum. Hidden between the aluminum plates of the V1 is a 28 mm IGUS bushing and nylon bushing plate. A 14 mm hex head bolt threads through a custom-made steel hitch block insert. This spring-loaded nut inside the square tube to draw the spigot tight against the hitch. The solid steel cube has 1\" of thread engagement to stop lateral play. A secondary nut on the far side of the hitch locks the bolt down. Khyber Racks also include a U-bolt hitch tightener. This piece isn’t unique to Khyber, but it’s great to see this eliminates any vertical movement. Khyber’s own patent-pending Speed Lock tie-down system uses a 6 mm static climbing rope. There are no plastic or rubber straps to break off or bungees to stretch out. Specifically placed knots tied in the rope aren't necessary either (aside from the two ends). This system adjusts to any tire or rim size as you cinch it into place. Price and Weight The materials and custom tubing are reflected in a higher initial cost, however, that should make the rack retain its shiny look for much longer. The racks start at $1,300 CAD for a fixed V2 2-bike. The price increases by $200 CAD for each additional basket and includes the according length wheel bars. The pivoting V1 racks start at $1,500 for the 3-bike carrier with the same increase in price per additional bike. There is a $25 up-charge for fat bike wheel baskets, however, there is no charge for a longer spigot (length may depend on the vehicle). Khyber Racks offer a lifetime warranty on their racks, including off-road use. Flat-rate shipping within Canada and the continental USA costs  $100 CAD ($70 USD). In order to make the racks ultra-stiff, Khyber starts with thick, custom-drawn square tubing. That trade-off comes with a size and weight penalty. Weights V1 - Multi Pivot Rack: Three Pack: 38 kg / 83 lb Four Pack: 42 kg / 92 lb Five Pack: 46 kg / 101 lb Six Pack: 50 kg / 110 lb Seven Pack: 54kg / 119 lb V2 - Fixed Pivot Rack: Three Pack: 34 kg / 75 lb Four Pack: 38 kg / 84 lb Five Pack: 42 kg / 92 lb Six Pack: 46 kg / 101 lb Seven Pack: 50kg / 110 lb Dimensions The 5-bike V1 rack measures 141 cm (55.5 in) wide (upper crossbar) and is 158 cm (62 in) tall in the vertical position. You can view all of the dimensions, including the V1’s dropped position here . Khyber suggests removing the upper cross-bar from the mast to make life easier. The rack also stores in a smaller area if broken down into two pieces. If you don’t opt for a larger rack (4-bike+) or aren’t regularly removing the rack, this probably won’t be a concern. Installation Before attempting to lift the rack in place, you’ll want to make sure the threaded block is inserted. A nice bonus here is that the spring attached to the block tends to hold it place while lifting the rack into place. Wresting the 5-bike V1 rack into the hitch receiver is possible, but the two-step assembly approach is a worthwhile tactic. There are two mounting options for the spigot which vary by 50 mm and will depend on the vehicle’s specifications. Once the spigot and block are lined up with the receiver, the main bolt threads in with a 14mm hex wrench. That gets tightened down firmly, followed by the secondary lock-nut on the opposite side. The U-bolt hitch tightener is installed last. Loading Bikes Placing each bike in the basket is easy with the right method. Khyber suggests holding the handlebars and pulling the bike on the back wheel using the rear brake. From there, rest the front wheel on the outer bend of the wheel basket and roll the bike in using your knee under the saddle to start the lifting move. Shorter riders may find it easier to load the bike from the side, lifting it in while holding the seatstay and fork lowers. The further back the rack is angled, the lower the lift. That of course will affect your vehicle's departure angle. The bikes load from left to right and the reverse for unloading. When fewer carriers are needed, bikes should be loaded closer to the center. Balance the weight out - heavier bikes should prioritize this zone too. The baskets have a weight limit of 25.5 kg (60 lb) each. The wheel baskets on the Khyber racks are angled so that each bike’s handlebars don’t interfere with one another. I have found that in certain cases you can load and unload central carriers, although there are limitations. As for the wheel tie-downs, the SpeedLock system has a picture engraved on the rack to explain the lacing pattern. The wheel should be lowered as far into the basket as possible. The rope is then pulled upwards to remove slack, and then laced from left to right over the rim before locking into the grip. Performance Before the first bike was loaded onto the Khyber V1, I realized how frigging burly this rack was. There was absolutely zero play or slop between any of the components. Off-road, this equates to the bikes moving less on the rack. The stiff wheel baskets and angled handlebar arrangement deters the bikes from bumping into one another, even through the worst potholes. With the SpeedLock system, the bike can’t be pushed up and out of the wheel basket either - something that can happen far too easily with some racks when driving through scooped-out water bars. The wheel baskets are also arranged such that the pedals will never contact the adjacent frame and the cranks are free to spin without getting tangled in the wheel bar. This wider spacing does decrease the number of bikes per wide compared to some other racks though. The downward pivoting action of the V1 system is much appreciated, however, it's slightly less than that of a NSR. Khyber does advise on opting for a swing-out hitch if you’re looking for maximum vehicle cargo access. Although I can appreciate the precisely drilled holes in the pivoting system, they can be tricky to line up the pin, especially when the rack is loaded - a small price to pay for a pivoting system that won't crap out. A helping hand obviously makes this process much easier. Six months later, the rack still looks and operates like new. None of the bolts have come loose, there's absolutely zero play in the pivot, it doesn't squeak, and no corrosion is visible (aside from the standard issue anti-rattle hitch clamp). Comparison The wheel basket design is supreme. It removes contact on the bike’s delicate surfaces and keeps bikes from popping out. Although the basket carrying method is not unique to Khyber, the construction is superior in reducing rack flex. The tie-down material is also fast, adaptable and the most reliable I've tried. North Shore Racks use a different carrying design where a rubber-coated prong cradles the fork crown. This relies on enough rubber, which does eventually wear down, to protect against the steel prong lurking underneath. Bikes can be pushed up and out of the fork prong should the bike’s rear wheel contact the ground. North Shore Racks are also a regular flavor of steel and treated with a powder coat. This finish eventually rusts and flakes off. As simple as it is to remove that with a wire brush and repaint it, that's not something you'll need to do with the anti-corrosion materials chosen for the Khyber racks. Compared to a 30 kg (68 lb) North Shore Racks (6-bike carrier with a straight mast), a 6-bike Khyber V2 Fixed rack weighs 46 kg (101 lb). The pivoting V1 rack tacks on an additional 4 kg (9 lb). In terms of width, a 5-bike Khyber V1 is roughly equivalent to the width of a North Shore Racks 6-bike carrier - a compromise worth making in order to reduce damaging your bikes while shuttling off-road."

Press Release: NZ MTB Rally Whilst it’s a race, our expectations are that at least half of the 120 riders will be here for the adventure, awesome trails, beautiful scenery, and party vibes; not necessarily keeping a close eye on their finishing times. Amongst these 120 riders are some serious competitors, 6 names stand out as having the biggest chance of featuring at the pointy end of the results. Matt FAIRBROTHER 2024 NZ MTB RALLY WINNER – Fully unsupported The young kiwi-grown adventurer set the benchmark for adventure last year by not only completing the NZ Rally fully un-supported, but also winning the whole race at the same time ! He’s back for this second edition, but this time as a regular, fully-supported rider. We're keen to see how fast Matt can ride when not exhausted after a 7 hours kayaking over-nighter.  Although in Matt's own words, he's main aim this year is to claim his fair share of the feed station food that he missed out on time around!  Matt will also be helping out with our media team - since he's a bit of a demon behind the lens, as well as the handelbars. Read about Matt's 2024 adventure @matthewfmtb How would you introduce yourself to an audience that doesn't yet have the pleasure of knowing you and what you do/did? \"I'm a young kiwi Enduro racer, most known for bikepacking hundreds of kms in between Enduro World Cup Races whilst still competing and most recently combining ultra-endurance with enduro racing by successfully attempting the NZ MTB Rally self-supported in 2024.\" What motivated you to race NZ RALLY again this year? \"The trails and atmosphere, the trails in Nelson are hard to beat but the vibes all week somehow make them exponentially better\" Which spot/trail is your favourite riding place during the race week? \"Probably Cable Bay, there is no shortage of goodness up there!\" What are you going to do with all this free time in the evenings as you won't have to pedal extra 100km every day this year? \"Put the feet up and relax!

I see the bike as the perfect tool for expressing myself in the mountains and I love getting off the beaten track. Over the years, I've developed a real passion for images, travelling and meeting people. And that's what I've been trying to promote over the last few years, to share this global vision of cycling. Cycling has opened my eyes to all these other aspects, well beyond the pleasure I get from riding. When I manage to put all these elements together, I'm happy, and I dedicate my whole life to it. \" What attracts you to this blind enduro stage race, and why try it now? \"What attracts me, like my previous answer, is the adventure. I see this event as a group adventure, where we all set off to explore the heart of the Top of the South Island of New Zealand. I don't like to use the word ‘race’ because I think it's more than that. It's certainly a sporting challenge, but above all it's an ideal opportunity to share time with other enthusiasts. During the day on the bike and over a beer and a BBQ in the evening. \" Like many of the participants, you're not here just visiting NZ during the race itself. What are your plans for New Zealand during your stay? \"I'm wrapping up two months of travelling in NZ with this event. During this period, I'm planning a fairly complete tour of the country. Without necessarily spending time in the best-known bike parks, I'm going to enjoy exploring the country from other angles. I'm also a regular mountain runner and I like to find nice mountain huts away from it all. I'd also like to find out more about the people, the history of the country... But I'd also like to spend more time on the coast, perhaps discovering new activities on the water. I see NZ as a very varied country and I want to experience that.\" You're a lover of adventure and discovery, but you're also a real competitor. How do you feel about racing against the likes of Sam Blenkinsop and above all Matt Fairbrother, winner of the first edition, in the conditions we all know? \"I also see myself as a competitor, or rather someone who challenges himself at every level. Through my various journeys and objectives of summits and volcanoes, but also on certain targeted races. I like to train, to be in shape, and to be able to express myself on the bike in this way too!

        "content": "The Complete Guide to the 2025 World Cup DH Teams: 2025 UCI Downhill Team Round-Up It's been a busy off-season of team rumours, with some big moves and changes for the 2025 season. With the list of teams revealed and the confirmed World Series teams, let's look at all the team moves and try to anticipate what the 2025 World Cup race season might bring. Who are the 2025 Gravity World Series Teams?: AON RACING - TOURNE CAMPERVANS Harriet Harnden, Monika Hrastnik, Henry Kerr, Stan Nisbet, Heather Wilson, Reece Wilson One of the most exciting moves of the silly season came from Reece Wilson's new Aon Racing team. Launching with a stacked lineup of riders, the team secured a World Series spot as one of the top 15 teams based on UCI ranking points. Alongside Wilson, the team features Monika Hrastnik, Henry Kerr, Heather Wilson and Hattie Harnden, who will be shifting her focus toward downhill this season. Axess Intense Factory Racing Joe Breeden, Louise-Anna Ferguson, Oscar Griffiths, Mille Johnset, Milatul Khaqimah, Fernando Juan Munoz The Intense Factory Race team made some moves during the silly season, picking up Mille Johnset from the Canyon CLLCTV and bringing on street racing talent Juan Munoz. CANYON CLLCTV FACTORY TEAM Troy Brosnan, Marine Cabirou, Henri Kiefer, Aletha Ostgaard, Luca Shaw As part of a streamlining process of its gravity race teams, Canyon is all in on its CLLCTV Factory team. Alongside the returning Troy Brosnan and Luca Shaw, the team has some big signings for 2025. The headliner of its 2025 additions is Marine Cabirou, who joins the team after an extended period on the Scott team. Alongside Cabirou, Henri Kiefer and Aletha Ostgaard join the factory Canyon squad for 2025. COMMENCAL SCHWALBE BY LES ORRES Lisa Baumann, Bode Burke, Austin Dooley, Matilda Melton, Jack Piercy, Antoine Pierron While we may have lost a few of the smaller teams in the off-season, it's great to see the Commencal Schwalbe by Les Orres team leading the charge into 2025 with a great line-up of current and future racing talent. COMMENCAL/MUC-OFF BY RIDING ADDICTION Max Alran, Till Alran, Dylan Maples, Myriam Nicole, Amaury Pierron, Gaëtan Ruffin, Loris Vergier Outside of signing the 2024 World Champ Loris Vergier the Commencal Muc Off team remains mostly unchanged after a successful 2024 season. Sadly Vergier and Dylan Maples are starting the 2025 injured but will hopefully not be out of action for too long. CONTINENTAL ATHERTON Dan Atherton, Gee Atherton, Rachel Atherton, Elise Empey, Charlie Hatton, George Madley, Luke Wayman Picking up one of the wildcard spots, the Continental Atherton team made World Series status despite sitting outside the top 15 teams based on rankings. Outside of the Atherton siblings, only Charlie Hatton remained with the team after 2024. For 2025, Elise Empey, George Madley and Luke Wayman join the team. CUBE FACTORY RACING Jess Blewitt, Max Hartenstern, Kasper Hickman, Rosa Zierl Another team picking a World Series wildcard spot is Cube Factory Racing. Alongside returning team members Jess Blewitt and Max Hartenstern, the team has signed Kasper Hickman and Rosa Zierl. FRAMEWORKS RACING / 5DEV Lucas Dedora, Anna Newkirk, Angel Suarez Alonso, Asa Vermette The Frameworks team continues to sit alongside the sport's biggest teams, featuring inside the top 15 based on ranking points after it added Anna Newkirk and Lucas Dedora to its roster in 2025. The team has also started a development squad called Future Frameworks. GIANT FACTORY OFF-ROAD TEAM - DH Dane Jewett, Jakob Jewett, Luke Meier-Smith, Rémi Thirion The Giant team made some rider swaps with the Pivot team as it saw Remy Meier-Smith replaced by Dane and Jakob Jewett. The Jewett brothers are joined by Luke Meier-Smith and Rémi Thirion. MONDRAKER FACTORY RACING DH Oriol Cuadrat Castells, Ronan Dunne, Ignacio Garcia Ayora, Ažbe Kalinšek, Dakotah Norton, Ryan Pinkerton, Veronika Widmann, Greg Williamson After an incredibly successful first year on the World Cup circuit the Mondraker downhill team has made some big moves for its second season of racing. After running a three-rider team in 2024, Mondraker will now support eight riders in 2025. The biggest new signings for the team this year are Veronika Widmann and Greg Williamson. MS-RACING Oli Clark, Jacob Dickson, Eleonora Farina, Sebastian Holguin Villa, Lucas Lagneau, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, Valentina Roa Sanchez, Gloria Scarsi, David Trummer The silly season saw some big changes for the MS Racing team, parting ways with Intense after one season and switching to Zerode bikes. Alongside a change in bike sponsors the team also expanded with Valentina Roa Sanchez, Gloria Scarsi, Sebastian Holguin Villa and Oli Clark joining the roster. NORCO RACE DIVISION Lucas Cruz, Lina Frener, Danny Hart, Gracey Hemstreet, Bodhi Kuhn, Greg Minnaar, Erice Van Leuven The Norco Race Division, led by Greg Minnaar, is another team making big changes for 2025 as the previously three-rider team expands with its latest signings including Danny Hart and Erice Van Leuven. Healing vibes to Erice after her massive crash at Hardline Tasmania. ORBEA / FMD RACING Phoebe Gale, Martin Maes, Darragh Ryan, Kaos Seagrave, Tahnee Seagrave, Oliver Zwar The FMD Racing team switched to Orbea bikes in the off-season as it also brought Martin Maes onboard for the 2025 season. As the only rider to have won both a downhill and enduro World Cup it will be interesting to see how Maes plans out his season. PIVOT FACTORY RACING Ryan Griffith, Jenna Hastings, Bernard Kerr, Remy Meier-Smith Pivot Factory Racing managed to grab one of the five season-long wildcard spots and will be at every downhill world Cup this season. Jenna Hastings, Bernard Kerr and Ryan Griffith are joined by new signing Remy Meier-Smith. SANTA CRUZ SYNDICATE Jackson Goldstone, Laurie Greenland, Felix Griffiths, Nina Hoffmann, Eliana Hulsebosch With Jackson Goldstone, Nina Hoffmann and Laurie Greenland sticking with the team in 2025, the Santa Cruz Syndicate grows to five riders, after two junior racing talents join the roster. To meet its aim to win in every World Cup category, the Santa Cruz Syndicate added junior racers Felix Griffiths and Eliana Hulsebosch for 2025. SCOTT DOWNHILL FACTORY Gonçalo Bandeira, Vicky Clavel, Benoit Coulanges, George Ethan Craik, Dylan Levesque, Hugo Marini After some big changes in 2024, the Scott Downhill team remains mostly unchanged. The only change for 2025 was the departure of Marine Cabirou and the signing of French talent Benoit Coulanges. After great success with the Dorval AM Commencal team, it will be interesting to see how Coulanges performs with his new team. SPECIALIZED GRAVITY Loic Bruni, Finn Iles, Jordan Williams No change on the Specialized Gravity team for 2025 as it sticks to its trio of elite male riders. Loic Bruni is currently healing a separated collarbone but is expected to be back in action for round one. TREK FACTORY RACING DH Oliver Davis, Sacha Earnest, Christian Hauser, Lachlan Stevens-Mcnab, Ella Svegby, Matt Walker Trek was another brand looking to simplify its teams for 2025, as only Sacha Earnest remained from its 2024 lineup of riders. Joining Earnest, Trek has signed a stacked list of riders with Oliver Davis, Christian Hauser, Lachlan Stevens-Mcnab, Ella Svegby and Matt Walker all onboard for 2025. YETI / FOX FACTORY RACE TEAM Camille Balanche, Richie Rude, Tyler Waite, Jonty Williamson Shifting its focus to downhill World Cup racing, the Yeti / Fox Factory is looking strong heading into 2025. Tyler Waite is joined by fresh signing Camille Balanche and 2024 enduro World Cup series winner Richie Rude, who is setting his sights on downhill this season. YT MOB Valentina Höll, Andreas Kolb, Oisin O'Callaghan, Kasper Woolley The big news for the YT Mob is the signing of Andreas Kolb from the Atherton team, making it the home of Austria's two fastest racers. Alongside Vali Höll, Kolb and Oisin O'Callaghan, Kasper Woolley has made the switch from enduro to downhill after a great performance at Mont-Sainte-Anne last year. What are the Other Entry Pathways for World Cup Downhill Racing in 2025?: For the riders and teams who have missed the cut for the 20 World Series team spots, there are still other ways to get between the tape at this year's World Cups. Check out a quick breakdown of the alternative entry pathways below. Single Round Wildcard Status: For the teams not given World Series status then there is the chance to be selected for one of eight UCI MTB Team wildcards. At each of the ten World Cup rounds scheduled for next year, the UCI will have eight wildcard spots allowing a UCI MTB Team to send up to four riders per race and category. The invites to a World Cup event will be decided one month before the selected World Cup event. To be given a wildcard event entry a UCI MTB Team will be judged on the following criteria: - UCI team ranking, current and previous season - Profile of any individual riders - UCI Team composition (multi-category, multi-gender) - Profile of team sponsors (out of industry, global, etc.) - Media profile of the team (social media, etc.) - Any injury issues during the current or previous season - Anti-doping history - Home country of team - Continental series team standing Similar to the season-long World Series team wildcard selection, the UCI has the power to request information or documents to assess the criteria for the eight wildcard event positions. Individual Rider Entry Based on UCI Gravity Ranking Outside of gaining entry through a World Series team or a wildcard team spot, riders can also get into World Cups with their ranking points. If an elite rider is inside the top 50 or a junior in the top 100 then they will be able to race at World Cups. Based on the current UCI rankings the top 50 riders are: Full rankings can be found here . Full rankings can be found here . Entry for National Federation Riders, Continental Series Golden Tickets & Current World/Continental/National Champions The final option for riders to still attend this year's World Cups if they are not on a World Series team is through their national federation, finishing in the top five at a UCI Continental Series race or if they are a current World, continental or national champion in downhill racing.

        "content": "Cape Epic 2025 Prologue Highlights, Results & Analysis: The results are in from the first day of racing at the 2025 Cape Epic. After 26km of racing, the Toyota Specialized and the Wilier-Vittoria teams secured the first victories of the week after a flat-out prologue stage. Annika Langvad marked her return to professional XC racing and, with teammate Sofia Gomez Villafane, took the prologue stage win by three seconds. Margot Moschetti and Samara Sheppard of the e-FORT x ChemChamp team put in a great effort to only give up three seconds to the Toyota Specialized team after the prologue. The next team completing the top three would be over a minute back, with over three minutes splitting the top five. Italian World Cup racers Luca Braidot and Simone Avondetto led the UCI men's standings on the first day of racing as the shorter 26-kilometre course suited the XC racers more than the marathon specialists. 20 seconds back, the Swiss pairing of Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo were the only racers within a minute of the prologue winners. Last year's winner, Matthew Beers, and teammate Keegan Swenson couldn't match the winning pace as they finished up the first day over two and a half minutes back. Check out the results and analysis from the prologue below and we will be updating this page with highlights from the opening day of racing soon. And so it begins. The 21st Absa Cape Epic, out of the hinterland and into the Cape Winelands. On the urban edge, but yet still wild and untamed. The iconic trails of Meerendal, Fair Cape Dairies and Hoogekraal host the opening Prologue time trial, providing a taste and a test of what is to come. Sharp climbs, sweeping singletrack descents and spectacular spectator points combine to produce a first day which will indicate to teams how well they have prepared for the 2025 race. — Cape Epic Full race replay: Results: UCI Women Top 5: 1st. Toyota Specialized - Annika Langvad / Sofia Gomez Villafane: 1:12:33 2nd. e-FORT x ChemChamp - Margot Moschetti / Samara Sheppard: 1:12:36 / +3 3rd.

Imbuko ChemChamp A - Marco Joubert / Tristan Nortje: 1:00:55 / +1:10 5th. MitoQ NZ Cycling Project - Craig Oliver / Ben Oliver: 1:01:00 / +1:15 Stage Analysis: Average Speeds Story of the Stage The Toyota Specialized team of Annika Langvad and Sofia Gomez Villafane were quick off the start line on the shorter first day of racing at this year's Cape Epic, quickly building a 51-second lead after 11 kilometres at the end of the third sector. While the leaders would build their lead against most through the following two stage sectors, Margot Moschetti and Samara Sheppard of the e-FORT x ChemChamp team began their fight back against the leader across the second half of the prologue stage, pulling back from a deficit of 51 seconds to only three at the finish line. For the UCI Men's race, there were two leaders across the 26-kilometre stage with the World Cup XC racers Luca Braidot, Simone Avondetto, Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo all helped to place their time at the top of the time sheets through the stage. While the Swiss pair of Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo did some damage on the second and third stage sectors, the eventual prologue winners were unmatched across the final part of the course, building a 20-second advantage after the first day of riding. The Outride Toyota Songo team of Matthew Beers and Keegan Swenson struggled to match the high pace of the leaders in the second half of the stage, seeing their gap to the leader grow from 15 seconds after sector three to over two minutes after completing the prologue. Sector Comparison for the Top 3 Finishers Annika Langvad and Sofia Gomez Villafane had a strong prologue stage to kick off this year's Cape Epic. The final sector was the only part of the course where both 2nd and 3rd placed teams took time away from the winners. The slower end to the stage almost cost the leading team the stage win as Margot Moschetti and Samara Sheppard pulled back from a 38-second deficit to three seconds after finding 35 seconds in just this sector. The third-placed riders, Vera Looser and Alexis Skarda, also had a fast final part of the stage, pulling twelve seconds back from the stage winners. The Italian pairing Luca Braidot and Simone Avondetto was dominant through the prologue stage as they made time up on 2nd and 3rd place teams in four of the six stage sectors. Sector two was the only part of the course where the stage winners gave up time to Scott-SRAM MTB Racing and the Honeycomb 226ers. The Scott-SRAM MTB Racing took the lead after the second sector, finding 30 seconds on the stage victors. Nino Schurter and Filippo Colombo could not best the Wilier-Vittoria team in any other sector, helping Braidot and Avondetto retake the lead."

        "content": "NZ MTB Rally Announce 2025 Event Details: PRESS RELEASE: NZ Mtb Rally The NZ MTB RALLY, second edition to be launched 22nd of March, for a 6-day adventure! What’s the NZ MTB RALLY? NZ MTB Rally is a week-long enduro-format adventure traversing New Zealand’s ‘undiscovered’ top-of-the-south region, comprising world-class trails in a pristine backcountry environment sandwiched between three national parks. 120 international competitors will complete a circular itinerary out of Nelson, taking in both historic tracks and IMBA gold-level bike trails. Amateurs alongside seasoned pros; this race is a bucket-list adventure as much as it is a competition….with properly rad logistics: If there’s a road, we’ll shuttle it. When that road gets rough, we’ll take our 4x4s. Where there’s no road at all, we’ll jump in our helicopters. And when there’s nothing but water…we’ll go by boat. That was so sick! — Rae Morrison The Rally’s circular itinerary comprises an original route conceived especially for the race. It is sandwiched between three National Parks and takes in a blend of historic backcountry tracks and purpose-built MTB trails. But if you're thinking machine-built bike park, you'll be in for a surprise. The trails in Nelson and the surrounding area consist almost entirely of hand-built singletrack built by an enthusiastic local MTB community comprising over 3000 active members. In simple terms, the NZ MTB Rally is an uplift-assisted enduro race. With 4 to 6 gravity-biased race stages per day, connected by scenic backcountry liaisons and shuttled uplifts using 4×4, helicopter and boat. Visiting a notably different ride spot each day from three different basecamp locations. It’s a route that gives the impression of going on a coherent journey with a purpose rather than simply cruising from one bike park to the next on a coach tour. \"Only\" a race...? Whilst it’s a race, we expect at least half of the 120-rider start list to be here for the adventure, awesome trails, beautiful scenery, and party vibes, not necessarily keeping a close eye on their finishing times. And likely showing only the vaguest of interest in the heroic fight for the podium going on at the top of the field. Or at least, that's what they are pretending is gonna happen. (What actually happens once you're between the tapes, is anyone's guess and plans of 'just taking it easy' and 'I'm not really here to race' are often forgotten). Awesome time doing some of the best trails around Nelson, including Heli-lifts, boat rides and lots of shuttles. Still, enough of challenge to do the extended race to be super fun yet engaging. Great crew and participants; it was a really memorable and rewarding experience! — Paul Cook NZ MTB Rally has a party-to-pedal ratio of well over 2 to 1: our typical day averages 600 – 1200m climb and 2300 to 3000m descent. For those who don’t relish shouldering their bike, fear not: we’re not into it either. “Hike-a-bike? Hell Nah, Bro! Why walk when you can take The Heli?” (preferably equipped whilst wearing aviator sunglasses and singlet, mullet shimmering in the breeze. Then, casually popping the cap on a cold Kiwi beer you just pulled from the overflowing cool box full of bevies that you’ve stashed in the trunk of your pickup, conveniently there all along…almost as if waiting for this very moment of manly glory). Over the week, we average about 70% backcountry and 30% bike-park stages, although when the park stuff is hand-cut beech forest goodness, we’ll forgive you if you struggle to notice the difference. We’ll throw in a groomer most days, but if you’re here for a proper Kiwi adventure… you’ve come to the right place. Phenomenal place to ride that has so much variety and different locations to ride. Best event of this style I have taken part in. So many good memories from the week. Can't recommend this enough. — Jake Lecluse 6 days adventure on the bike Day 1: The Wairoa Gorge 8 stages // 28km // -2700m // +660m The NZ MTB Rally 2025 kicks off with a thrilling first day of racing in the deep, rugged valley of the now-famous Wairoa Gorge, a former private Bike Park built by a secretive billionaire in the 90s for his private use. Riders battle through technical singletrack with steep and gnarly descents, all of them hand-built over several years by a trail crew picked out from amongst the world’s best. The day ends with a cold beer and a well-deserved BBQ on the finish line, right after the suspension bridge, while cheering at the last riders coming in! Day 2: NEW – Silvan and Richmond Hills 5 Stages // -2100m // +450m Riders who are coming back for the second year in a row will enjoy this new day for sure ! Silvan Forest MTB Park offers an exciting mix of scenic beauty and flowy trails with panoramic views of the surrounding hills and coastline, the experience combines adventure with stunning natural landscapes, and of course, fully shuttled! We couldn’t also dream of a better place to finish than this really cool amphitheatre with live music and barbecue facing the ocean and the next destination: Golden Bay! Day 3: Golden Bay 5 stages // 45km // -2650m // +780m This third day will take the rider into the Abel Tasman National Park, to explore its dense native forest, through slippery and rooty single-tracks! Last stage of the day will take the rider to the beach of Kaiteriteri for a well deserved cold beer, enjoying the sunset on the next destination, on the other side of the bay : Cable Bay ! It was just incredible to ride, I love this kind of trail! — Morgane Jonnier Day 4: Cable Bay 6 stages // 26km // -2100m // +750m Ready to set sail, matey?! Today is boat-day, starting with a 80-minute sunrise boat cruise across to Cable Bay. An awesome experience, with breakfast and coffee served onboard to top off the experience, and if we get lucky maybe even a few dolphins to join the party ! And if you get a bit sea-sick, don’t worry, riding the amazing trails of Cable Bay Adventure park will heal you up in no time! With a perfect mix of flow and gnarly trails, hand-shaped between native and pine-tree forests, this place has everything for an awesome day of racing! Not to mention the quality of the feed station there! Day 5: Heli Day // WAKAMARINA 3 stages // -1350m // +475m Wakamarina trail is a must-do in Nelson area for all back-country adventure lovers ! And the adventure starts with an epic Heli-ride up to a tiny clearing in the middle of a wooded ridge, with no other option out than down an incredible single-tracks making its way between the black beeches, huge native ferns and crystal clear rivers ! Day 6: NELSON CITY 5 stages // 31km // -2700m // +600m The final day showcases the best of the riding around town, straight from and to the accommodation in the city centre to discover all the amazing trails built and maintained by Nelson MTB Club Riders race towards the finish line, knowing they’ve conquered one of the toughest MTB challenges in the world. The event concludes with a grand ceremony and party, celebrating both the winners and the incredible achievements of all participants. Highly recommend, once in a lifetime event with an amazing crew to hand. Can't wait to go again and improve. — Rich Paull WHO'S RACING? There is a pretty cool lineup of international pro riders who registered for this year's NZ MTB RALLY; the race to the highest step of the podium is going to be really interesting We'll announce them in an article next weekend, but can you guess who?

        "content": "Review: Chris King's New US-Made MTN30 Aluminum Wheels: Chris King has been producing American-made bicycle components for nearly 50 years, and have been based out of Portland, Oregon, since the early 2000s. In 2022  they launched their first mountain bike wheelset, which used carbon rims made in Utah by FusionFiber. Now, an aluminum wheelset has been added to their catalog, also with US-made rims. Designed for trail and all-mountain usage, the MTN30 AL wheels are available in 29”, mixed, and 27.5” configurations, with either Centerlock or 6-bolt disc mounting. (Side note: as someone who prefers 6-bolt mounting, it’s great to see that Chris King has returned to offering both options after going Centerlock-only for a bit). MTN30 AL Details • Wheel size: 29\", 27.5\", or mixed • US-made aluminum rims • Internal rim width: 30mm • 32 Sapim Race spokes. 3-cross • 5-degree engagement • 6-bolt or Centerlock hub options • 2-year rim warranty, lifetime hub warranty • Rim weight: 29” 595g / 27.5” 565g • Weight: 2162 grams (mixed wheelset) • Price: $1,250 USD • chrisking.com The rims are laced to Chris King’s MTN hubs with 32 Sapim Race J-bend spokes and brass nipples. My mixed-wheel setup weighed in at 1035 grams for the front and 1127 grams for the rear, for a total of 2162 grams. The wheels are priced at $1,250, and come with a 2-year warranty against defects for the rims, and a lifetime crash replacement program where a new rim can be purchased at a discount. Those terms aren’t as generous as what we’ve seen from companies like Reserve or Race Face recently, where their rims are covered by a lifetime warranty. The MTN 30 wheels do have a lifetime warranty on the hubs, though. DESIGN Chris King hasn’t disclosed exactly who is making their aluminum rims (it’s not Velocity), but they were designed in-house, rather than being chosen from a catalog of existing options. The numbers are fairly typical for modern mountain bike wheels, with a 30mm internal width and a 19mm height. The rim bead has an external hook that’s designed to help ward off pinch flats - a wider surface is less likely to cause a puncture when a tire is smashed against it. The rims have a matte black finish, but the hubs are available in 10 different hues for riders that want to add some color to their ride. As for those hubs, they’re the same Mountain Hubs that Chris King has been producing for years, with a proven design that uses a RingDrive mechanism (pictured above) with 72 points of simultaneous engagement. That equates to 5-degrees between engagement points, putting them in the 'quick but not crazy quick' engagement category. A special tool is required for a full service, but a basic bearing maintenance doesn’t require anything out of the ordinary. PERFORMANCE I’ve had these wheels on either a Santa Cruz Bronson or a Raaw Madonna for the last three months, and they’ve seen more than their fair share of wet conditions. After all those muddy miles the wheels are still spinning smoothly; impressively smoothly in fact - get them spinning on the bike or in the truing stand and they’ll just keep going and going. There aren’t any dents or dings to speak of, and I haven’t had to true them at all - they’re still properly tensioned and free of any hops or wobbles. I did need to snug down the preload collar on the rear wheel after a couple of rides, a quick procedure that eliminated any side-to-side play, and I haven't had to touch it since. As for ride feel, I’d place the MTN30 wheels on the stiffer side of the spectrum. They’re stout and solid, the type of wheels that you don’t give a second thought about smashing into corners as hard as possible. They’re billed as being for trail and all-mountain usage, but I don’t see any reason they wouldn’t work well for even more aggressive riding. They’re noticeably stiffer than Santa Cruz’s Reserve HD wheels, and I wouldn’t call those wheels especially soft to begin with. For bigger riders that don't like the vague feeling that can occasionally come along with more 'compliant' wheels this will be a positive attribute, or really for anyone that places a high priority on wheels that are responsive and precise. On the flip side, these wouldn't be my first pick if I was searching for wheels that were on the more comfortable side of the spectrum. Harsh is too strong of a word to describe the MTN 30 wheels, but they also don't mute that much trail feedback. It wouldn't be a wheel review without mentioning the hub sound. With these wheels, I found the signature angry bee sound was fairly subdued, and I didn't find it to be obnoxious at all. As for the functionality, there was zero skipping or slipping from the freehub, and the 5-degrees between engagement points was quick enough that I never thought twice about it, even when working my way through slower speed, more technical climbs. Comparison Chris King hasn’t made it easy for themselves in the comparison department - there are currently multiple options that offer a better price and weight ratio. Reserve’s 30|HD aluminum wheels are the most obvious contender - those are 100 grams lighter, $550 cheaper, and now come with DT Swiss' DEG hub, which has an oversized 90-tooth ratchet ring for 4-degrees between engagement points. There are even carbon wheels for less than the Chris Kings - Roval’s Traverse HD wheels come to mind; those are 1830 grams laced up to Industry Nines 1/1 hubs. Along with being lighter, they have an excellent ride feel, and a very wide rim bead that does a good job of preventing pinch flats. Of course, for some riders the fact that the rims and hubs are made in America is going to be part of the appeal. I'm going to avoid wading too deep into the political sea, since it's looking pretty polluted at the moment, but there is something to be said about purchasing items that are manufactured close to home, no matter where you live. Reserve HD: 2036 grams  / $699 USD Roval Traverse HD (carbon) : 1830 grams / $1,110 I9 hubs Chris King MTN30 AL: 2162 grams / $1,250 Pros + Stiff and strong + Super smooth, fast rolling hubs Cons - Not that light for a trail wheelset - No lifetime rim warranty Pinkbike's Take The pre-built wheel market is more competitive than ever, and it’s tough for a $1,250 alloy wheelset to stand out. Realistically, it’s the made-in-USA angle that’ll steer some riders towards these wheels, and Chris King’s hub quality shouldn’t be downplayed either - those are very nice hubs, and with occasional maintenance should last a lifetime. — Mike Kazimer Visit the high-res gallery for more images."

        "content": "Two BC Riding Facilities Shutting Down for Pickleball: Pickleball is taking over—at least, that’s how it seems. This past week, two riding areas, Send Air and the Gleneagles Adventure Park in coastal BC, announced they are shutting down to make way for the new big dog of recreation. This follows similar news from North Shore Bike Park, which recently announced its closure for an indoor pickleball facility in North Vancouver , and Bline Bike Park in Calgary, which met the same fate back in March 2024 . SendAir Send Air, an indoor airbag training facility on Vancouver Island, announced on Instagram that a pickleball company outbid them on rent, forcing them to shut down effective May 1st. The park, located inside a large indoor soccer complex just outside Parksville, features a variety of airbag setups—from a small bag for beginners to its main attraction: a 24-foot roll-in leading into a 14-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide, 50-foot-long landing bag. As one of the only facilities of its kind in Canada, Send Air has become a hotspot for professional riders looking to train and progress safely. Send Air will be closing for the foreseeable future on May 1st, A pickle ball company approached the owners of our facility and far outbid any rent price we could afford, so business is business and Send Air has to go. Our sport has very specific needs for our building, about a 40 ft roof is required and 15,000 sqft, so getting a replacement building isn't as easy as signing a new lease down the road and setting up the ramps, this type building is actually quite rare and expensive to build and therefore rare and expensive to rent. For now the send air dream will be on pause, I have to decide what comes next and figure out the best way forward without having our facility. Cheers to all you legends who have came here to shred and support my vision, its been a wild ride — Send Air Gleneagles Adventure Park West Vancouver’s council has approved funding to explore the redevelopment of Gleneagles Adventure Park, a long-standing skatepark and dirt jump park in Horseshoe Bay. The plan includes replacing the existing facilities with four pickleball courts and a multi-use pump track, a move that has sparked both support and strong opposition from the community. With $28,000 allocated for design work and cost estimates, the project could move forward as early as spring 2026. The skatepark is regarded as a world-class facility that has drawn riders from around the globe for the past 20 years. Many believe its removal would be a significant loss for West Vancouver’s youth and for athletes training in Olympic disciplines like skateboarding and BMX. Supporters of the redevelopment argue that the current facilities are underused and in poor condition. Steep transitions are cited to have made the skatepark less accessible to beginner riders, while the bike park is limited in its usability thanks to erosion and weeds. According to council, a pump track would create a more inclusive, multi-generational space, allowing riders of all ages and abilities to gather. Additionally, the new pickleball courts would provide local players with walkable access to the growing sport, reducing the need to travel to centralized locations like Ambleside. A Change.org petition is circulating to urge planners to reconsider their decision. The petition acknowledges that the dirt jumps have fallen into disrepair but emphasizes the park’s importance in Canada’s skate and BMX scene. It proposes a compromise: removing the dirt jumps and installing pickleball courts in that area and part of the large parking lot rather than eliminating the skatepark altogether. The petition can be found here."

We thought a couple of the moments from the past week were too good not to share with a wider audience, so here are some of the highlights. Swampfest 2025 - Day Zero Swampfest 2025 is here! The wildest event in BMX returns to Florida and it looks as good as ever. Hit play and check out Day Zero and get a taste of all the madness that's going to go down this weekend! — Our BMX Swampfest 2025 - Middle Finger Jam Here we go! Let the Swampfest 2025 games begin! First up, we have the Source BMX Middle Finger Jam. In memory of the one and only Fids, the jam was pure chaos—exactly how he would’ve wanted it… Legends never die, and this was the perfect way to honor a true one. Hit play and watch the madness unfold. — Our BMX Swampfest 2025 - Day One Mayhem Things get wild before the events even start at Swampfest 2025! From riders breaking in the DIY setups to full-send off a giant wooden monster truck, the energy is already at an all-time high. With everyone hyped and ready to go, you already know the main events are going to be insane. Hit play and splash (ha) into the madness! — Our BMX Swampfest 2025 - Coffin Ledge Jam The events keep coming, and the chaos doesn’t slow down! The Shadow Coffin Jam is next up at Swampfest 2025 and it was absolute mayhem—with near misses, a close packed crowd, and zero room for error, this jam was as sketchy as it gets. Somehow, most made it out unscathed… but not without a few close calls. Hit play and see how it all went down — Our BMX Swampfest 2025 - Limousine Jam The events keep coming, and the chaos doesn’t slow down. Pretty sure more people fell than pulled anything during the Pit Viper Limo Jam but let's just run with it as is. Hit play and see how it all went down — Our BMX Swampfest 2025 - Curved Wall Of Doom Next up we have the Dan's Comp Curved Wall ride (of Doooooom!) At Swampfest 2025. Basically a curved wall ride suspended above a pool… Puddle of SWAMP water. If you don’t hit it just right, you’re going in for a swim. Sketchy, wild, and 100% Swampfest certified.

Sooooo hit play and get ready to go full speed and dive in the swamp — Our BMX Drop Testing with Brendan Fairclough & Olly Wilkins In the depths of the Surry Hills we came across a huge step down drop off. Now ‪Olly Wilkins had already road this mad mountain bike feature but along time ago and before it had suffered a hard winter of rain. We had our E- bikes with us which in hindsight may not have been the perfect option but asa you can see everything did work out just fine in the end. — Brendan Fairclough Charlie Murray's 2024 EDR Season Wrapped Last season was chaos. With some big crashes, close calls, and some of the coolest trails the Enduro World Series has ever thrown at us. From torrential rain in the Pyrenees to alpine trails in Switzerland, it was a season I’ll never forget. But it wasn’t just about the wins or the crashes  it was about pushing limits, travelling Europe with a bunch of cool people, and chasing the podium every step of the way So, if you want to see the highs, the lows, and everything in between, stick around. This is my season summary of the Enduro World Cup 2024 — Charlie Murray Benoit Coulanges' Flat-Out Test Laps Pre-Season Enduro Testing with Alex Rudeau Kings and Queens of Corbet's 2025 Highlights Kings & Queens of Corbet’s held its sixth competition at the most famed couloir in North America on February 11, 2025. The world's best skiers and snowboarders took the stage at the awe-inspiring venue that is Corbet’s Couloir and ‪Jackson Hole‬ Mountain Resort to showcase their progressive style at the steepest in bounds run in North America in hopes of greatness. From massive frontflips, to impossible wallrides, and explosive crashes, this was a day to remember. Sit back, relax and watch how Olympians, X Games winners, and Freeride World Tour champions took on the 2025 competition.

        "content": "Pinkbike Primer: Your Essential Guide to the 2025 Cape Epic: Photo by Gary Perkin/Cape Epic/SPORTZPICS Pinkbike Primer Cape Epic 2025 The Cape Epic is back for 2025 as it returns to challenge the world's best across eight days and 603 kilometres of racing. Across the week, riders will go from the Prologue in Durbanville to the grand finale at the end of the week in Somerset West. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Cape Epic. The Schedule The 21st edition of the Cape Epic brings new trails and challenges for racers with over 300 kilometres of trails never before used by the event. The 2025 doesn't just bring fresh trails as the organiser has introduced a new time trial test. Check out the breakdown of each stage below. March 16 Prologue: And so it begins. The 21st Absa Cape Epic, out of the hinterland and into the Cape Winelands. On the urban edge, but yet still wild and untamed. The iconic trails of Meerendal, Fair Cape Dairies and Hoogekraal host the opening Prologue time trial, providing a taste and a test of what is to come. Sharp climbs, sweeping singletrack descents and spectacular spectator points combine to produce a first day which will indicate to teams how well they have prepared for the 2025 race. — Cape Epic March 17 Stage 1: Stage 1 has a reputation for being a shot across the bows, a day which sees hopes dashed and protagonists for the week ahead stake their claims. 2025 will be no different, steep gradients are the order of the day which begins benignly enough before devolving into a brutal series of back-to-back climbs. There will be no strength in numbers or hiding in a group. It will be team vs team, mano a mano, across the cols of the Cape. — Cape Epic March 18 Stage 2: A spicy new feature for the 2025 Absa Cape Epic. A point-to-point time trial. A true test of teamwork, tactics, and tenacity. No time to “fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way.” With climbing in the opening and closing kilometres linked by rolling roads, dual tracks and trails across the vlakte of the Malmesbury Farms. It should be a day which suits the powerhouses of mountain biking, though the weather could have a pivotal say in who succeeds on Stage 2. If the South Easter howls or the African sun bakes down, even the strongest could wilt en route to Fairview. — Cape Epic March 19 Stage 3: Another big day of trails and tribulations awaits, packed with rewarding singletracks, but equally testing with precipitous ascents - Stage 3 could mark the turning point in 2025 fortunes. A good showing on the Paarl Mountain will set teams up for a storming race through the second half of the week, while a loss of momentum could result in a floundering for fitness and form. Gritting one’s teeth and holding on to the dream – from dawn to dusk – is the only way to endure, overcome, and excel. — Cape Epic March 20 Stage 4: The granite domes of Paarl Mountain soak up heat, producing a microclimate of scorching summers. This will undoubtedly come into play during the 2025 Absa Cape Epic, as the sun could drain teams more than the route or the racing’s tests. Dropping a chainring size and redoubling one’s determination will be required to conquer a second day in the pearl of the Winelands. Its fynbos and vineyard beauty belies the difficulty of racing across the rocky outcrops and between the intimidating 500-million-year-old granite intrusions. — Cape Epic March 21 Stage 5: The epic Stage 5 of the 2025 race is the only day to reach triple digits and is fitting of its brutal crown. A long, point-to-point route, it will challenge with a series of arduous ascents. Depending on how one looks at the profile there are either four or eight climbs to conquer. Mixing dual track with trails it is a day designed for aggressive racing, attacks and counters. Though it is also a course which will play into the hands of those who have recovered best, avoided drama, and conserved their energy for the final weekend. — Cape Epic March 22 Stage 6: The penultimate stage treats Lourensford and its neighbouring farms like a mountain biking playground in a day of discovery. The slopes of the Helderberg Mountain and its foothills - which stretch through neighbouring farms - provide ample opportunities to for tired legs to be tested. While spectacular trails through vineyards, fynbos and orchards cut through soils over 21 types, from deep red clay to shallow alluvial gravel. It is a day when the Grand Finale looms, but one where so much remains to be ridden. — Cape Epic March 23 Grand Finale: The Grand Finale is the last chance to fly. And fly each team must as they ascend towards glory and swoop through the singletracks for the final time during the 2025 Absa Cape Epic. A circumnavigation of the Helderberg Dome ensures it will be a difficult day, complete with a return from a different direction to the highest point in the race. There will be reasons to celebrate aplenty too, however, with the singletracks of Ernie Els, Dornier and the famed Helderberg Trails all providing parting gifts. The last descent, through exquisite fynbos in reserve on the urban edge, brings the 21st Absa Cape Epic full circle. Closing with cheers, nerves replaced by elation, and a slot in the Book of Legend. — Cape Epic What's the Weather Expected to be? Ahead of a week of gruelling racing the weather could provide another level of challenge for riders with high temperatures at the start before the second half of the race brings with it wetter conditions. Sunday March 16 Nice with sunny periods // 26°C // 2% probability of precipitation // wind 17km/h Monday, March 17 Brilliant sunshine and pleasant; breezy in the afternoon // 27°C // 0% probability of precipitation // wind 33km/h Tuesday, March 18 Warmer with sunny spells // 33°C // 0% probability of precipitation // wind 13km/h Wednesday, March 19 Mostly sunny and very hot; danger of dehydration and heat stroke if outside for extended periods of time // 41°C // 2% probability of precipitation // wind 9km/h Thursday, March 20 Mostly sunny and cooler; a thunderstorm around in the afternoon // 32°C // 40% probability of precipitation // wind 6km/h Friday, March 21 Occasional showers in the morning; otherwise, periods of sunshine // 30°C // 75% probability of precipitation // wind 7km/h Saturday, March 22 Cloudy with a little rain // 22°C // 55% probability of precipitation // wind 13km/h Sunday, March 23 A little morning rain; otherwise, mostly cloudy // 23°C // 61% probability of precipitation // wind 9km/h Weather forecast as of Saturday, March 15. 2024 Recap Anne Terpstra and Nicole Koller were among four teams of pre-race favourites, but the Dutch/Swiss pairing proved imperious throughout the race. Ghost Factory Racing won all eight stages, becoming only the second team to do so since the women’s race gained UCI status in 2014. Their success relegated Candice Lill to her fifth successive second-place finish in as many editions of the Absa Cape Epic. Ghost Factory Racing’s daily dominance of the top step of the podium belied the competitiveness of each stage. In fact, the Aramex UCI Women’s race has never been closer, over the 20-year history of the event. — Cape Epic 1st. Ghost Factory Racing - Anne Terpstra / Nicole Koller: 30:56:22 2nd. Cannondale Factory Racing - Mona Mitterwallner / Candice Lill: 31:04:58 / +8:36 3rd. Toyota-Specialized-NinetyOne - Sofia Gomez Villafane / Samara Sheppard: 31:32:10 / +35:48 4th. e-FORT PrivateClientHoldings - Léna Gérault / Hayley Preen: 32:40:59 / +1:44:37 5th. Efficient Infiniti SCB SRAM - Vera Looser / Alexis Skarda: 32:43:43 / +1:47:21 Ahead of the 2024 Absa Cape Epic each of the pre-race favourites spoke about how luck would play a key role in determining the eventual champions. Though Nino Schurter’s warning proved most prescient “Specialized have shown that time and again that they know how to minimize their misfortune” … The Swiss star has now raced nine editions of the Absa Cape Epic. Despite having worn yellow in each of the last two races he has had to watch Matt Beers ride away victorious. This is in part due to the South African, and his American partner's resilience. Howard Grotts required a couple of stages to find his international racing legs. Once he did there was no stopping him. — Cape Epic 1st. Toyota-Specialized-NinetyOne - Matthew Beers / Howard Grotts: 25:22:17 2nd. World Bicycle Relief - Nino Schurter / Sebastian Fini: 25:33:24 / +11:07 3rd. Buff Megamo - Hans Becking / Wout Alleman: 25:33:53 / +11:36 4th. Canyon SIDI - Andreas Seewald / Marc Stutzmann: 25:40:04 / +17:47 5th.

        "content": "Continental Adds SuperSoft Enduro Casing Kryptotal & Argotal: Not a moment too soon, Continental has added SuperSoft compound options for its popular Kryptotal Fr and Argotal tires in the Enduro casing - in 29\" x 2.4\" only. Until now, the SuperSoft rubber was only available on their Downhill casing tires, but now you can get it on the lighter Enduro casing. I have enjoyed the mixed-conditions Kryptotal Fr tire, but the SuperSoft Enduro option was always the gaping hole in their lineup. Also new and notable is the addition of a Soft compound option in a Trail casing - for the Kryptotal Fr tread pattern only. Again, this new casing and compound combination is only available in 29\" x 2.4\". Sadly, 27.5\" tires are left behind with this update. The Kryptotal Fr is also now available in 20\", 24\", and 26\" options, which are sure to be welcomed by free-riders and younger riders on smaller bikes. To summarise, the new options are as follows: New Compound and Casing Options: • Kryptotal Fr - Downhill Casing - Soft Compound - 60-622 • Kryptotal Fr - Enduro Casing - SuperSoft Compound - 60-622 • Kryptotal Fr - Trail Casing - Soft Compound - 60-622 • Argotal - Enduro Casing - SuperSoft Compound - 60-622 New Size Options: • Kryptotal Fr - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 60-406 • Kryptotal Fr - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 60-507 • Kryptotal Fr - Enduro Casing - Soft Compound - 60-559 • Kryptotal Fr - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 65-622 • Kryptotal Fr - Enduro Casing - Soft Compound - 65-622 • Kryptotal Re - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 60-406 • Kryptotal Re - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 60-507 • Kryptotal Re - Enduro Casing - Soft Compound - 60-559 • Kryptotal Re - Downhill Casing - Soft Compound - 65-584 • Xynotal - Trail Casing - Endurance Compound - 65-584"

        "content": "Long Range Enduro Announces 2025 Event Details: PRESS RELEASE: Long Range Enduro On the west coast of the easternmost island in North America lies a small mountain bike town: Corner Brook. Every year since 2022, the Long Range Enduro (LRE) has drawn riders from all over the island and Atlantic Canada to our little town for an unofficial week of shenanigans leading up to the LRE. Prior to 2022, the LRE was part of the St. John's Enduro series until it grew large enough to stand on its own! Corner Brook is a small city with fewer than 20,000 residents, and its history is rooted in the lumber industry, particularly with the pulp and paper mill that helped build what is now modern Corner Brook in the 1920s. It’s clear that the attraction to Corner Brook today, for many people, is the great outdoors. No matter the time of year, you’ll always spot a car with a bike rack, tailgate pad, or rooftop ski box. It has that \"I’m home\" feeling for those who love the outdoors. A large number of the LRE riders come from outside of Corner Brook and its surrounding areas, and in the week leading up to the event, it becomes very evident! Most of these riders come from the capital of the province, St. John's. The local slang for them is “the townies,” and there is a friendly and fun rivalry between the townies and the locals of the west coast. A week before the event, the townies start to arrive, rushing to get their practice in and try to make up for the west coasters' home advantage. The chirps start to be heard throughout the valley. The LRE is a community event, and it's one of the best parts of the event. Each year, local businesses come forward to support the event, many of them from the start of the event in 2022, continuing every year since. The event simply wouldn’t happen without them. The local MTB Association, the West Coast Cycling Association (WCCA), and trail builders work hard all summer leading up to the event to get the trails in top shape while also expanding the local network more and more each summer. If there is one saying that stands out for the LRE, it is the classic “It takes a village,” and this village is made up of the small but extremely dedicated group of volunteers from WCCA, LRE, the trail builders, race organizers, volunteers, and community sponsors. Perhaps one of the best things about the event itself is the mix of riders who are there for the competition and those who are just there to have a laugh. Throughout the day, you can tell who is treating the event like a huge group ride with party laps and who is locked in, pushing for the podium. Each segment has a volunteer posted up with a Bluetooth speaker and an electric vibe, hyping up the riders before they dive into the next race segment. This turns the entire valley into one big fun party atmosphere, and any pre-race jitters are squashed by laughs and friendly chirps! The beauty of the WCCA’s network is the variety of trails and who can ride them, as well as who can enjoy them. Riders as young as 12 years old, all the way up to 65+, set out for a day of fun. The valley is full of trails that both amateurs and pros can navigate. The two race classes have a distinguishing feature that sets them apart: one of the valley's less forgiving trails, which helps separate the true amateurs from the more advanced riders, and a significant increase in distance and elevation. With an average of 32 km and over 1000 meters of elevation gain, the expert race is quite the feat, especially given the history of the LRE’s weather, which has either been soaking wet or scorching hot! The award ceremony after the race is growing into its own event, with all 100+ riders showing up, followed by volunteers, friends, family, and even those who just happen upon the event. It’s evolving into a festival-like atmosphere! There’s endless food and beverages to go around while everyone refuels and anxiously waits to hear who took the podium this year. As you wait, you start to hear chatter about so-and-so crashing, someone saying they feel like they've got it, and others just stone-faced, waiting to hear the results! The past two years have been more exciting and high-stakes than others, with a local legend coming out of retirement to secure first place, leaving the townies behind in the adult category. Then, the entire U19 podium was held by the WCCA trail crew, who spent more time working on the trails and riding than anyone else. One U19 rider even blew everyone out of the water with staggering numbers! It’s truly an electric atmosphere at the event’s ceremony! So, will we see you at the 2025 Long Range Enduro? Saturday, August 2nd, 2025. Humber Valley, Newfoundland. A special thank you to Dru Kennedy for the photos used in this article, and our trail builders that work tirelessly in the background, it wouldn't happen without you!"

        "content": "Ambit Releases Oval Mounted GC Carbon Handlebar: PRESS RELEASE: Ambit Components Meet the Ambit GC Carbon Handlebar– a bar that challenges the idea that stiffness is king and instead strikes a new balance between precision, Micro-Flex, and control. This oval design isn’t just about looks – it’s engineered to filter out trail chatter without sacrificing steering accuracy. It’s the kind of change that doesn’t scream at you visually but becomes impossible to ignore once you start riding. Rethinking Carbon Handlebars We’ve all been there – bombing down a trail, arms getting more fatigued with every rock, hands buzzing long after the ride is over. Carbon handlebars have come a long way in tuning stiffness and weight, but most still fall into two categories: Too stiff, transmitting every hit straight to your hands, or too soft, robbing you of the precision you need to trust your front end. We set out to break that pattern with a progressive oval-shaped design. The proprietary carbon fiber layup redefines comfort without sacrificing control. It’s a subtle effect, but it’s one you feel rather than see. Eliott Lapotre, Ambit athlete, was one of the first to test it: The oval shape looks insane, and the comfort while riding feels super smooth and stable at the same time. — Eliott Lapotre The GC Handlebar wasn’t just developed in isolation. It went through the usual lab stress tests, but more importantly, it was tested by riders who push their gear to the limit. Ambit’s R&D team put it through back-to-back tests against a traditional round carbon bar with identical layup. The results? • Over 25% more flex, allowing the bar to absorb more vibrations while maintaining control – helping reduce fatigue on long descents. • Maintained steering stiffness, so control remains razor-sharp. • Micro-Flex instead of noticeable bend, keeping feedback precise without jarring your hands. After four days of riding in Finale Ligure, my hands still felt fresh – the oval shape absorbs vibrations, reducing fatigue and making the ride noticeably smoother. — Markus Reiser It’s one thing to hear the numbers. It’s another to realize you’re less fatigued after a multi-day trip, with hands that don’t feel like they’ve been through a jackhammer session. More Than Just Micro-Flex The GC Handlebar isn’t a flexy bar – it’s a precision-engineered balance of Micro-Flex and control. The oval-to-round transition at the clamping area ensures a rock-solid interface with the stem, preventing unwanted flex where it matters most. The patent-pending handlebar uses an Oval-to-Round aluminum shim, providing a secure mechanical lock. This way, it is compatible with standard 35mm stems. Does It Ride Different? Short answer: Yes (at least we here at Ambit think so). Long answer: It’s not a night-and-day change you notice in the parking lot, but it’s something that creeps up on you over a long ride. That one descent where your hands don’t cramp up as usual. That extra bit of control when the trail gets fast and rough. That feeling of being less wrecked at the end of the day, even though you rode just as hard. It’s the kind of difference that makes you not want to go back to a standard bar once you’ve felt it – we believe. Specs • Width: 800mm (trim down to 750mm) • Rise: 25mm / 35mm • Backsweep: 8° / Upsweep: 5° • Weight: 230g (25mm) | 235g (35mm) • Max stem clamp width: 70mm / 80mm (DH version) • Max torque: 6Nm (stem) / 5Nm (lever clamps) • Material: Carbon (handlebar) / Aluminum 6061 T6 (shim) • Price: €199.00 Available now – check it out here"

        "title": "First Ride: Fox's New 34 SL - More Fork, Light Weight",
        "author": "Dario DiGiulio",

        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-fox-34-sl-more-fork-light-weight.html",
        "content": "First Ride: Fox's New 34 SL - More Fork, Light Weight: Cross-country bikes are increasingly capable machines, and the corresponding racecourses have gotten gnarlier in tandem. To keep up with the times, every piece of the XC bike puzzle has to squeeze more out of less, improving ride quality without adding weight. To that end, Fox has updated their XC fork platform, with the 34 SL representing the sharp end of their short travel race efforts. Yes, it's 3% heavier, but the performance gains are a whole lot more than 3%. 34 SL Details • 110, 120, 130mm travel • 2.5\" max. tire size • Grip SL or Grip X damper • Updated air spring and chassis • Weight: 1490g, 130mm Grip SL • Price: $649-1,099 USD / $869-1469 CAD / $1149-1899 AUS / £749-1259 • ridefox.com Historically, Fox's cross-country platform has been a shared effort between the 32 and the 34, both with their Step-Cast lowers design. That unique design allowed for a very narrow stance, reducing material and therefore weight. It allowed for up to a 180mm rotor, and was compatible with the Grip and Grip SL dampers. Much of that goes away with the introduction of the 34 SL, which implements a wider stance, more damper compatibility, and a full-size air spring - all without adding a significant amount of weight. The 34 SL also takes up some of the normal 34's purview, as light trail bikes can benefit from the updated air spring and damper options that you can get with the 34 SL. That said, the 130mm max travel leaves room for something else in the lineup. Features Along with the updates to the 34's chassis comes an expansion of the XC fork's purview. The 34 SL will be available in 110, 120, and 130mm travel increments, to suit the gamut of XC bikes on the market, including those toeing the line of the trail category. In keeping with that, the native brake mount has been bumped up to a 180mm rotor, and can be run with up to a 203mm rotor if you so choose. The theme is more. The new arch shape was reached using the same generative design programs that yielded last year's reverse-arch 32, with the goal of maximizing stiffness and strength while minimizing material. The same work was done to the crown, which is now made from 7000-series aluminum and features internal machining to shave further weight. For those looking for numbers, the new design increases torsional stiffness by 17%, as reported by Fox. Fox chose not to integrate bleed valves (fart buttons) into the casting of the 34 SL, as the smaller volume of the fork tends to build up less internal pressure with elevation or weather changes. The bypass channels - the raised vein on the back of the current forks - have been moved to the interior faces of the fork, where they cause less friction under regular use. With the wider stance of the fork, you also gain wider tire clearance. Fox quotes the maximum at 2.5\", with a measured 2.4\" aggressive XC tread fitting with plenty of room for mud or wheel deflection. Like most of Fox's fork lineup, you can opt for any of their multiple damper options to suit your needs. The primary two on tap here are the Grip SL and the Grip X. The SL focuses on weight and simplicity, with a 3-position sweep to adjust compression damping, and a single tool-free knob to adjust rebound. The Grip X has high- and low-speed compression adjustment, as well as low-speed rebound. The Grip SL damper is 50 lighter than the Grip X, and the Grip X is 70g lighter than the Grip X2. The Twin Stick In tandem with the revitalized XC fork platform, Fox is also launching a new lockout and dropper lever system, specifically for cross-country riding and racing. The two-lever remote can lock and unlock the fork and shock, as well as actuate the dropper post. Twin Stick is compatible with either 2 (Open, Firm) or 3-position (Open, Medium, Firm) suspension lockout systems. It can be set up for fork only, shock only or fork and shock simultaneously. This feeds into Fox's claim that they offer the lightest overall XC suspension system, including a dropper post. Their breakdown on that claim is shown below, highlighting their lightest components vs. the assumed equal from other brands. Pricing & Availability Pricing is separated by product tier, which shakes out into Fox's standard hierarchy: Performance Series, Performance Series Elite, and Factory. The aftermarket pricing is as follows: Performance models: $649 USD / $869 CAD / $1149 AUS / £749. Features: Grip damper, black stanchions, 120mm aftermarket, QR axle, 6000-series crown. Performance Elite models: $999 USD / $1339 CAD / $1699 AUS / £1119. Features: SL or X damper, black stanchions, 120mm aftermarket, Kabolt SL axle, 7000-series crown. Factory models: $1099 USD / $1469 CAD / $1899 AUS / £1259. Features: SL or X damper, Kashima stanchions, 110-130mm aftermarket, Kabolt SL axle, 7000-series crown. Twin Stick Dual Remote Lever: $149 USD / $199 CAD / $269 AUS / £185. Ride Impressions Over the past few weeks, I've had the chance to ride two variants of the 34 SL. First is a 120mm Performance Elite fork with a Grip X damper, specced on an XC bike you'll learn about at a later date. The second is a 130mm Factory fork with a Grip SL damper, which I've tried on the same bike and an Arc8 Evolve FS that I'm testing long-term. If you've managed to parse through all the different variation options, you'll note that the 120mm Grip X fork is a bit of a special combo - builds like that are available to OE customers, and will probably show up on plenty of complete bikes. While that 120mm fork has been without issue for the past month of riding, the SL damper fork had to go back to Fox for a rebuild, as the rebound valving stack was generating some feedback as the fork extended. I've been told that was a pre-production issue, and that the stock SL dampers should be a-okay. In both configurations, the fork has a distinct XC flavor to it, but the updated air spring and reasonably sturdy chassis can facilitate some real riding. Both bikes feel comfortable in typical trail riding scenarios, but still offer all the zest you'd expect of a light and efficient XC bike - and the forks match this sensation well. Where the 34 Step Cast can feel a bit twangey , the 34 SL does a better job of holding shape through rougher sections of trail, leading to less work from the arms and an easier time holding a given line. The air spring does a good job balancing grip and support without feeling like you're plowing through travel, thanks to the solid dampers they've packed into the little fork. While the Grip X damper's performance can feel a little caught in the middle on trail and enduro bikes, the level of support and feel of the damper suits the XC platform well. I think the weight savings and simple performance of the Grip SL damper will appeal to some, but those looking to play with their setup more might prefer the Grip X. As the newest XC competitor, I'll be working on a side-by-side comparison of the 34 SL, the SID, and the Manitou R8, to see how they all stack up. All in due time."

        "content": "Rebecca Henderson Will Miss XC World Cup Opening Rounds After National Champs Crash: Rebecca Henderson will miss the opening rounds of the 2025 XC World Cup season after a first-lap crash at this year's Australian National Championships resulted in shoulder and thumb injuries. Facing cold, wet and windy conditions at last weekend's Australian XCO National Championships , Rebecca Henderson battled through pain after a first-lap crash to take her 21st XCO national title. After the race and having received CT, MRI and X-ray scans, Henderson has shared that the crash left her with a fractured shoulder and a possible fracture in her thumb. In the latest update following her national championships crash, Henderson said she will not need surgery for her injuries but will miss the XC World Cup rounds in Brazil. Henderson said: No Brazil is a huge hit for me. I made some big commitments to myself last year that I was going to go all in and be back at my best and see what was possible.\" Pain, grit, and victory. Hitting the ground mid-race wasn’t part of the plan, but giving up was never an option. Bec pushed through, fought back, and crossed the line on top. A win that came with extra battle scars. Wishing you a quick recovery, Bec. This one was earned the hard way. — Orbea Factory Team Watch a full update from Henderson on her injuries below. We wish Rebecca Henderson all the best with her recovery and hope she is back racing soon."

        "content": "Race Report: NZ Mtb Rally - Days 1 & 2: Words: NZ Mtb Rally The highly anticipated NZ MTB Rally 2025 has officially begun, delivering an unforgettable adventure through the breathtaking landscapes of the Nelson region, not to be confused with (Nelson, BC, Canada). The first two of six day of racing showcased challenging terrain and stunning scenery, reaffirming the event’s reputation as one of the premier multi-day Enduro-adventure races in the world. 120 Riders from around the world convened at Nelson, New Zealand, this weekend for the second edition of the NZ MTB Rally. We're pleased to see that more than 10 people (so 8%!) joined the first edition and came back for more! Excitement was high, with a promising weather forecast and a bucket list itinerary lined up for this week-long Enduro. For the majority of racers, this would be their first visit to the Nelson region, located at the Top of New Zealand's South Island. Whilst Nelson's reputation for long, raw, natural tracks is legendary in NZ racing circles, Nelson has remained very much under the radar to international audiences compared to the likes of Queenstown and Rotorua. The NZ MTB Rally promises to change that with a week-long, best-of-the-best, wild-ride travelling itinerary. A fresh McCashins (ginger) Beer, new friends from all over the world, and the perspective of an amazing week ahead of you... That's the feeling of Day 0 at the NZ MTB RALLY ! The Rally’s circular itinerary comprises an original route conceived especially for the race; sandwiched between 3 National Parks, taking in a blend of both historic backcountry tracks and purpose built MTB trails. But if you're thinking machine-build bike park, you'll be in for a surprise. The trails in Nelson and the surrounding area consist almost entirely of hand-built singletrack built by an enthusiastic local MTB community comprising over 3000 active members. In simple terms, the NZ MTB Rally is an uplift-assisted enduro race. With 4 to 6 gravity-biased race stages per day, connected by scenic backcountry liaisons and shuttled uplifts using 4×4, helicopter and boat. Visiting a notably different ride-spot each day from three different basecamp locations. It’s a route that gives the impression of going on a coherent journey with a purpose rather than simply cruising from one bike park to the next on a coach tour. A BILLIONAIRE'S PRIVATE BIKE PARK 7 stages // 28km // -2800m // +660m 4X4 SHUTTLES // ALL. DAY. LONG. With so much great riding on offer across the Top- of-the-South Island in NZ, there was no time to ease them in gently, so first up was a 30-minute shuttle from camp down a narrow gravel track deep into The Wairoa Gorge. This deep, rugged valley was purchased back in the ’90s by a secretive billionaire in order to create his own rider’s Disneyland for his exclusive, private, personal use. It was hand-built over several years by a trail crew picked out from amongst the world’s best. Sam Blenkinsop, fastest rider on Day 1 Destiny would have it that the entire site was recently gifted to NZ’s Department of Conservation, who in turn handed it over to Nelson MTB Club for operational management. (Sweet as, billionaire bro!) This is no fairy-tale, just 72 km of exquisitely crafted beech-forested goodness, accessed all day long by a fleet of 4x4 shuttles and privatized for Day one of the NZ MTB Rally. Game on! 8 Stages of beech-forest goodness were on the menu, split over three long uplifts up the park’s steep central shuttle road. A 4x4 fleet of various shapes and sizes, including Mitsubishi Tritons, a fleet of Troop-Carriers, and specially adapted, jacked-up 4x4 ski-field busses were needed to shuttle up all these riders on this rough terrain! Anyone here thinking 2800m of descent in a day is no big deal would best be advised to reserve comment until the end of the day. These are 100% hand-built tracks, and while they are amazingly flowy and rewarding if you work hard, they will physically punish you if you don’t. Either way, don’t expect more than the briefest of moments of off-the-brakes cruising at any point whilst on stage today! An impressive suspension bridge spanned the clear waters of the river, bringing racers directly out to the finish paddock area. Those who had already finished their day were more than happy to line up at the finish and watch the spectacle of their competitors tackling this trail, descending from on high across the valley. The subsequent heckling was inevitable...and encouraged by the organizers, who even provided vuvuzelas and air-horns to anyone who wanted to get rowdy about it. The atmosphere at the finish line was electric as riders swapped stories about their best runs and near-misses over a traditional Kiwi sausage sizzle by the iconic suspension bridge. With cold beers and ciders, one ice from local award-winning brewer McCashins in hand, the day ended with laughter, high-fives, and the excitement of what lay ahead. From left to right: Sam Blenkinsop takes the win on this first day, with a total of 45mn48sc, Kilian Bron is only 4sc behind him and Matt Walker 11sc! Tuhoto Ariki, the NZ DH Champion, is 4th, and these tight gaps promise an amazing fight for the win during the week! Vivine GUNTENSPERGER, from Swiss, is leading in the women category! Matt Fairbrother Injured Sadly, Matt Fairbrother, the heroic winner of the first edition, had an unfortunate crash on stage 2 and injured his shoulder. He will be okay but won't be able to keep racing this week. Get well soon, Matt! Time to go back to base camp to charge the batteries and get ready for Day 2! Flow, Views, and Good Vibes - 5 Stages // -2450m // +690m Day two brought a total change of scenery as The Rally moved toward a totally new destination, one not used in the first edition: Silvan Forest and the open ridgelines of Richmond Hills, combining lush singletrack with expansive coastal views. Silvan Forest Mountain Bike Park is a privately owned 180-hectare forest with Matt, the landowner, a keen mountain biker (and actually racing NZ MTB Rally this year - talk about home trails advantage!). Established through a collaboration between the Griffin family and the MTB Trails Trust, the park features well-graded single-track climbing paths and exhilarating downhill runs suitable for various skill levels. Riders can enjoy stunning scenic views of the surrounding landscape. Today's course tags together three separate trail areas by including Jenkins Hill and Kingsland Forest, with four big shuttles and stunning transitions across the tops of the Richmond Ranges between stages. The Richmond Hills introduced a different flavour of wide-open ridgelines with fast, loose descents that rewarded big speed and confidence Silvan Forest delivered a mix of tight, twisting singletrack and fast, sculpted berms, winding through towering pine trees and dense native bush. The grip was incredible, allowing riders to push their limits and truly let the bike dance through the turns. Beyond the riding, the atmosphere was unbeatable. Cheering spectators, stunning panoramic ocean views, and a relaxed post-race vibe made the day feel more like an epic group ride than a competition. The day finished at the jaw-dropping Silvan Steps, an outdoor amphitheatre that usually hosts music concerts. Today, it was beers and a BBQ where we enjoyed fresh game caught by the local hunters in the surrounding area. This is what the NZ MTB RALLY is all about! The kind of day that puts a big smile on your face for a long time Dusty day, happy day! The top three gather at the finish line, comparing times… We're up against real pro riders with incredible consistency! The rankings and tight gaps are almost identical to day one. Sam Blenkinsop holds onto the lead with an additional 4 seconds ahead of Kilian Bron, who Sam Walker closely follows. But there's still a long week ahead! Tuhoto Ariki, currently in 4th place, is still very much in the game. Vivine GUNTENSPERGER is leading the female category with 1:37:17sc of total time racing in two days. With two days down and four to go, the NZ MTB Rally is proving once again why it’s one of the most unique and exhilarating MTB stage races in the world. The mix of technical riding, wild landscapes, and an incredible community spirit creates an experience that goes far beyond racing—it’s about exploring, connecting, and making lifelong memories on the bike. Up next? The rally heads toward Golden Bay, where more iconic trails, epic backcountry adventures, and unforgettable moments await.

        "date": "03-21-2025",

        "content": "Intend Releases New Essential Upside-Down Enduro Fork: PRESS RELEASE: Intend BC The Intend Essential Enduro fork expands Intend BC's portfolio with a more affordable upside-down model. It fulfills the desire to ride an upside-down fork without overstretching the budget. Positioned as a mid-range enduro fork, it is neither too heavy nor too light. It is equally suited for trips to Finale as well as for use in climb-friendly enduro bikes. A modular upgrade program also allows buyers to upgrade to the latest internals at any time. Intend is known as a manufacturer of suspension forks assembled in Freiburg, Germany, and this remains unchanged with the Essential. Each fork is expertly assembled by hand, with every bushing individually calibrated—following the same standards as our higher-end Originals and Blackline models. Despite its lower price, we do not compromise on quality. The Essential meets the toughest suspension fork test program at the EFBE testing laboratory with its E-Gravity certification. What's the Difference? The Essential uses a simpler internal design. Instead of having an externally adjustable travel like the Travelizer air spring unit, its travel is adjusted internally using clips. It also doesn't include the closed damping bladder from the Optimized damping system. Instead, it features a maintenance- friendly, semi-open oil bath that still self-bleeds. The outside counts too: As always with Intend, the chassis features high-quality, precisely machined components. The crown utilizes BCT (Bonded Crown Technology) and comes with a gray Cerakote® coating. Visually, this distinctive crown is the most recognizable feature of the Essential fork. Top Performance Despite More Affordable Production and Assembly All familiar adjustment options remain unchanged. The damping system features both high-speed and low-speed compression and rebound damping. The low-speed damping can be individually adjusted for both compression and rebound. Travel, spring rate, and air spring progression can also be adjusted. Details Details Let's be honest: The Ebonite model, a right-side-up fork, wasn’t a lasting success for Intend. Customers’ initial hesitation toward the upside-down design didn’t translate into strong sales for the Ebonite. And over time, our upside-down suspension forks gained popularity. As a result, some Ebonite tubes remained unused. While technically compatible, their tapered upper section made them unsuitable for our closed Optimized cartridge and our curve-optimized Travelizer air unit. These Ebonite tubes are now used in the Essential, which is why the first production run is limited to just 85 units. That said, future replacements are secured, as the Essential forks remain compatible with the stanchions from our current fork line-up. *All conversion upgrade prices incl. labor costs, limited to EU-customers Pricing & Specs Pricing: 1449€ incl. 19% VAT Travel: 150 - 180mm Brake Mount: 180/203/220mm, Post Mount Boost Dropouts: 15x110mm Boost Axle to Crown: 581.5 mm (170mm travel), 571.5mm (160mm travel), ...

        "content": "Canyon Announces New Exceed XC Hardtail: Canyon’s Exceed hardtail has been a mainstay in cross-country racing for nearly a decade, racking up wins at XCM and XCO World Cups. But with modern XC courses trending rougher and more technical—making full-suspension bikes the go-to for top-tier racing—the 2025 Exceed shifts its focus. While it’s still a lightweight race-ready hardtail, Canyon has reworked the geometry and frame features to improve descending stability and adventure capability. Exceed Details • Carbon Fiber Frame • Built-in frame protection and storage • 5 Sizes: XS-XL • 67° head angle • BSA Threaded BB • Weight: 10.1 kg / 22.3 lb, CF9 Build Kit • Price: 1999 € - 4999 € • www.canyon.com The biggest change is a slacker 67-degree head angle, a longer reach, and an extended wheelbase—small but noticeable tweaks that should add composure when things get steep. The rear triangle has been tuned to reduce lateral stiffness, aiming to improve comfort and control in rough sections. Canyon’s familiar VCLS 2.0 carbon flex seatpost returns on higher-end models, absorbing chatter while still allowing for future dropper post upgrades thanks to a new 31.6mm seat tube diameter. The Exceed has developed a following beyond the XC start line, particularly in bikepacking circles. It’s lighter and faster than a full-suspension setup yet more capable than a gravel bike, making it a compelling option for riders covering big miles on mixed terrain. The new model keeps that versatility in mind, with space for three bottle cages (except XS frames) and a larger front triangle to accommodate bigger frame bags. For additional storage, Canyon has integrated a down tube compartment, allowing riders to stow essential tools without taking up space in a frame bag. A third bottle mount under the down tube can double as a tool or accessory storage point, adding more utility for long-haul riders. The 2025 Exceed includes modern XC touches like UDH (Universal Derailleur Hanger) compatibility for easier drivetrain serviceability, additional frame protection against rock strikes and heel rub, a BSA threaded bottom bracket for straightforward maintenance, and clearance for 2.4” tires. Canyon’s IPU (Impact Protection Unit) also prevents handlebar over-rotation in a crash, reducing the risk of top tube damage. The Exceed lineup consists of five models, ranging from the €1,999 CF 5 to the €4,999 CF 9. Component specs vary, with forks from RockShox and Fox, drivetrains from Shimano Deore to SRAM X0 Eagle Transmission, and a mix of DT Swiss and Reynolds wheelsets. The bike is available in three color options: Berlin Sky, Azzurro Cielo, and Cosmos Black. The new Exceed will be available on March 20th through Canyon’s website and app. www.canyon.com"

And fly each team must as they ascend towards glory and swoop through the singletracks for the final time during the 2025 Absa Cape Epic. A circumnavigation of the Helderberg Dome ensures it will be a difficult day, complete with a return from a different direction to the highest point in the race. There will be reasons to celebrate aplenty too, however, with the singletracks of Ernie Els, Dornier and the famed Helderberg Trails all providing parting gifts.

        "content": "Richie Rude Runs Through His Favourite Trails in Whakarewarewa Forest, Rotorua: Presented By: Crankworx Photography: Clint Trahan Rotorua is a name synonymous with geysers and steaming landscapes, historic Māori culture, amazing spa and wellness offerings and more. But, there are also lush native forests and some of the best dirt on the planet. To mountain bikers, Rotorua is more than just a tourist hotspot – it’s a world-class riding destination. Whakarewarewa Forest, affectionately known as The Redwoods, is a place where ancient geothermal landscapes meet perfectly sculpted trails, drawing in riders from every corner of the globe. With more than 200km of purpose-built tracks, Whakarewarewa has played host to both weekend warriors and the world’s best downhillers. The trails offer a bit of everything from flowy jump lines to steep, tech-laden descents. And the best part? The legendary Rotorua dirt – hero dirt – grippy, loamy, and confidence-inspiring no matter the conditions. It’s no wonder elite riders return year after year to test their limits in this unique terrain. There’s something about the way the trails ride here — the rhythm, the grip, the connection to the whenua (land) — that’s unlike anywhere else on Earth. And when someone like Richie Rude hits Rotorua’s trails, it’s a masterclass in power and precision, as displayed in the video below. A Dirt Unlike Any Other Rotorua's volcanic soil is free-draining, meaning trails stay tacky and rideable year-round, even after heavy rain. The almost spongy surface provides grip like nowhere else, making every berm, jump, and root section more predictable, more playful, and more forgiving. It’s a mountain biker’s dream and keeps them coming back time and again. Must-ride Trails in The Whakarewarewa Forest With such an extensive network, it can be hard to know where to start. Here are some of the standout trails that capture the essence of Rotorua’s legendary riding scene. Tūteata A recent addition to the network, this trail blends high-speed flow with technical features, offering riders a perfect mix of challenge and fun. Expect tight corners, gap jumps, and roots that keep you on your toes, all set within lush native bush. Eagle vs Shark One of the most iconic flow trails in the forest, this is a must-ride for those who love big berms and endless speed. Smooth, sculpted corners and well-placed rollers make it an absolute dream ride, delivering the kind of fun that has made Rotorua mountain-biking famous. Hot X Buns A thrilling mix of technical root features and high-speed sections, Hot X Buns provides a dynamic ride that keeps even the most experienced riders engaged. Its mix of flow and challenge makes it a favourite. Tokorangi While winding up and through the bush to spectacular views over Rotorua, riders are treated to a mix of flowing corners and technical root sections that keep things interesting. Challenge Roadside A classic Rotorua favourite, this trail is packed with fun, fast corners and small jumps that reward smooth riding and good line choice. Corners True to its name, this trail is a berm-lover’s paradise, with perfectly shaped turns that let you carve deep and carry speed effortlessly. Te Mounga One of the more technical descents in the network, Te Mounga delivers steep chutes, rock gardens, and tight switchbacks, making it an exciting challenge for advanced riders. The Full Whakarewarewa Experience Beyond the headline trails, Whakarewarewa Forest is home to an immense variety of riding experiences. From the longest Whakarewarewa Forest Loop (a scenic 33km, mostly Grade 2 ride perfect for e-mountain bikes) to the gnarliest pro-level tracks used for premier international events such as Whaka100 and Giant 2W Gravity Enduro, there’s something here for everyone. The forest is easily accessed via two key entry points: Waipa Mountain Bike Park and Te Pūtake o Tawa. These locations also offer bike rentals and repairs, shuttle services to higher trails, and post-ride amenities like showers and cafés. Waipa also features a camp ground, isite Visitor Information Centre and Secret Spot Hot Tubs. If Whakarewarewa Forest isn’t already on your bucket list, it should be."

Jolanda Neff secured another early season victory in the mud as she once again proved her prowess in tricky conditions with a winning margin of nearly three minutes at the finish line.

        "content": "Peripheral Vision: 20 Must-Watch Videos From Outside the World of MTB - March 2025: Rory Bushfield - Barefoot Pilot: This short follows professional skier and stuntman, Rory Bushfield, as he grapples with his past by living in the present. His latest idea is something only he could have dreamt up – to barefoot waterski behind his airplane. A journey through Rory’s past reveals the experiences that have shaped him. From skiing and aviation to love and loss – these are the pillars of his life that drive him to live large. Rory finds strength and purpose by using fear to bring positive energy to each and every day, and push the boundaries of action sports in a way that is uniquely his. Erik Elstran - Get Weeird: Erik Elstran spent just eight days in Austin, Texas riding with friends and filming with local lensman Trent Lutzke. The resulting video is incredibly entertaining and action-packed with weeird conceptions of bicycle trickery, as-per-usual with Erik's riding. We hope you enjoy this one as much as we did! Filmed by Trent Lutzke. Edited by Erik Elstran. Condor Syndrome: Czechia's Robin Pflug and filmer Krystof Krechler have been hard at work on this over the past two years and it turned out awesome. Robin has a penchant for the tuck no-hander (AKA the condor) so the title of this one was already handled. Combos for days! Enjoy. \"Robin Pflug has been a known name in the Czech BMX community for more than a decade now and is most known for his sick condor style combinations. Hence the name \"Condor Syndrome.\" Anyway we wanted to make something really special for our Czech BMX scene, to push the bar a little bit - not only on the spot/riding side but mainly on the production side. I personally wanted to show that if you put a little extra care to the post-production - editing, grading, titles - it really can give a video that special feel. So we have been filming for a little over two years - between June 2022 and October 2024. It was really just me and Robin, with some tripod assistance from our homies. All the spots are in Czechia and they really cover the whole spectrum - park, street, dirt. Also fun fact: the last clip spot has never been hit on a BMX before.\" - Krystof Krechler. Video: Krystof Krechler. Dennis Enarson & Kevin Peraza - Guest List: Guest List 15 is now live! Featuring Odyssey's Dennis Enarson, who invited the transition annihilator, Kevin Peraza. Such a great pairing. Enjoy! Bobby Puleo - Epicly Later'd: Bobby Puleo is known for effortlessly skating the seemingly un-skateable. In this episode of Epicly Later’d, he takes us from New Jersey’s rough ’90s streets to San Francisco’s emerging scene and back to New York, where he refined his signature style. Bobby unpacks his creative process, shares his take on conspiracy theories, and gets candid with peers about his journey. Down Straight Up! Vol. 3: Monster continues its global tear and GT fires first, followed by a barrage from his fellow teammates. Jake Yanko's full-speed attack makes a powerful closing statement. Swampfest 2025: If you thought Swampfest couldn't get any crazier, you haven't been paying attention. This year, Gregson and the gang go toe-to-toe against Florida's floating death traps, concrete monstrosities, and literal gators. Fire it up. Weazy: An intricate balance between technical precision and free-flowing caution-to-the-wind, Craig Murray’s skiing is at its core an ode to his early life experiences with a family that supported and pushed each other constantly. Gifted the nickname \"Weazy\" when he was young, he's still notoriously tricky to pin down. Nowadays, you are more likely to find him quietly moving through the mountains with a mindset shaped by the natural world, and informed by a deep desire to understand and steadily evolve one's own physical and mental limits. Motherload: It is often said that the hardest part of any adventure is getting out the door. Planning and packing are tedious and time consuming. But the moment you cross over the threshold from the distractions of the real world to the freedom of the hills, everything seems to just fall into place. (Said no mother ever.) Follow professional skiers and mothers Izzy Lynch and Tessa Treadway as they carry the load of loss, life changing events, and the love of their children into the mountains where they find the moments of peace, growth, and healing that help them carry on. Jeremy Jones & Mia Jones - Twilight Of Adolescence: Twilight Of Adolescence shares a touching view of Jeremy Jones' family snowboarding dynamic. With his daughter Mia heading off to college in the fall, Jeremy and Mia celebrate their last full season riding together with a late spring High Sierra splitboarding mission. Teaching her the ways of the backcountry basecamp and sharing turns on serious lines, Jeremy relishes every moment with Mia. He offers a perspective on watching your kids come of age that any parent will appreciate. Madison Rose Ostergren - Fuel: This is a ski film that celebrates being your self. Madison Rose wants the world to know that you should just be you! Starring: Madison Rose Ostergren. Video: Iz LaMotte. Torren Martyn - Nordurland: Nordurland is a film about going surfing in the harsh, cold waters of the North Atlantic. It follows three friends from the subtropical northern rivers of NSW Australia, surfers Torren Martyn and Laurie Towner, as well as needessentials founder and designer Ryan Scanlon. They travel to isolated, snow covered coastlines in search of remote waves and filmmaker Ishka Folkwell, beautifully captures these vast and stunning landscapes on screen. With an original soundtrack composed for the film by Headland, glaciers, mountains and powerful icy surf all come to life in this adventure to the far north. Torren Martyn's narration throughout the film offers a personal reflection on the trip and a real glimpse into the challenges and rewards of traveling to frozen, distant lands in search of surf. Brothers Of Climbing: How can you be what you can’t see? Mikhail Martin, co-founder of Brothers of Climbing said, “I literally typed, ‘Are there black climbers?’ in Google... someone said, ‘black people don’t climb.'” A small group of climbers began to challenge that thought. The Brothers of Climbing is a crew that's making the climbing community more welcoming. Watch to see how they created a community where one wasn’t. Doug Tomkins - Wild Legacy: Douglas Tompkins was a world-renowned adventurer, entrepreneur, and​ ​conservationist. The founder of The North Face and cofounder of Esprit, Doug spent the first half of his life building successful, global brands, while simultaneously adventuring around the world, completing first descents of the world’s toughest rivers. In 1968 Doug embarked on a trip to Chile, driving with friends from California to the tip of Patagonia. Documented in the film Mountain of Storms, the trip solidified Doug’s place as a rock climbing legend. In the early 1990s, Doug sold his part of Esprit and turned his entrepreneurial energies to land and wildlife conservation projects in South America, working alongside his wife, Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, the former CEO of Patagonia, Inc. Over the last 25 years, Tompkins-initiated efforts have helped secure 4.75 million acres in new protected areas in Chile and Argentina including five new national parks. Collaborating with several presidential administrations and other partners, the Tompkins Conservation family of nonprofits has helped create six national parks in Chile and Argentina and is working to establish at least five more. A Wild Legacy tells the story of Doug’s incredible life, his lasting impact on the wild landscapes of Patagonia, and Kris and the Tompkins Conservation team’s efforts to continue his audacious mission. Doug was tragically killed in a kayaking accident on Lago General Carrera, north of Patagonia Park, on December 8th, 2015. “If anything can save the world, I’d put my money on beauty.” – Douglas Tompkins The Finisher: In 2024, Jasmin Paris made history by becoming the first woman to finish the Barkley Marathons, widely known as one of the hardest races in the world and a defining test in ultrarunning and trail running. With over 100 miles of brutal terrain, cryptic course markings, and a near-impossible success rate, the Barkley has long been considered the ultimate challenge in endurance sports. \"The Finisher\" chronicles Jasmin’s extraordinary three-year journey (2022–2024) to achieve this groundbreaking feat. The film features exclusive interviews with legendary race director Lazarus Lake, ultrarunning icons Courtney Dauwalter, Amelia Boone, and Jared Campbell, as well as rare insights from Jasmin herself. Through never-before-seen footage from her home mountains in Scotland, in-depth analysis of her Barkley race strategy, and a deep dive into her endurance athlete mindset, this documentary reveals the resilience and determination behind one of the greatest achievements in ultrarunning history. Whether you're fascinated by the Barkley Marathons, inspired by women in endurance sports, or eager to witness an incredible story of perseverance, The Finisher is a must-watch. Walmsley: “UTMB is not conquerable by a human, it's conquerable by the human spirit. And you need to harness the spirit in order to accomplish the goal.” Jim Walmsley discovered ultra trail running through an unconventional journey. After participating as a track athlete in high school and college, he transitioned to the military, serving in a nuclear missile silo in Montana. He was eventually dismissed, leading him back to running, where he emerged as one of America's top ultra trail runners. Following impressive records at the Western States 100, Jim sought a new challenge: the infamous Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB). Despite initial failures, he committed to enhancing his mindset and training, bringing him to relocate to France with his wife, Jess. In 2023, Jim achieved a historic victory, becoming the first American man to win UTMB in a thrilling mid-race twist. He now joins the ranks of great American women who have triumphed in the race before him. The Art Of Bear Acting: How bears act. Phil Tippett - The Making Of Star Wars: Oscar-winning stop-motion animator Phil Tippett reflects on his career working alongside George Lucas on the Star Wars original trilogy, from his humble beginnings as an alien patron in the iconic Cantina sequence from Star Wars: A New Hope, to pioneering stop-motion techniques used throughout Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

        "content": "Race Report: NZ MTB RALLY - Days 3 & 4: Words: NZ Mtb Rally Sam Blenkinsop is still leading the provisional overall ranking from (only?) 46sc As the second edition of the NZ MTB Rally 2025 reaches its third day, the energy and excitement among riders continue to build, setting the tone for an unforgettable week of riding. The 120 international riders have already had an impressive overview of what Nelson Tasman has to offer in terms of riding, after one day experimenting with the steepness of Wairoa Gorge and the next cruising on the best flow trails of the Sylvan and Richmond Hills! At this stage of the week, the rally spirit is in full swing—camaraderie runs high as riders from around the world share stories over evening meals, celebrate epic rides, and prepare for the challenges ahead. With three more days to go, the stoke level is undeniable, and anticipation is building for what’s next. So, if you've missed the action from the two first days, check this out . At this point, Sam Blenkinsop is leading the overall ranking with a cumulated racing time of 1h19:36sc, only 8sc ahead of Kilian Bron and 21sc ahead of Matt Walker, so the race is really tight for such a long race, and nothing is done yet—there's 4 more days to go! Now, time to head off to Abel Tasman National Park & Cable Bay! From Takaka Hill to the beach - 6 stages // 45km // -2050m // +490m Day 3 of the NZ MTB Rally takes riders on an extraordinary journey through a diverse and expansive landscape, including a rare opportunity to ride through a National Park—a privilege granted exclusively for this event. Today's course offers a contrast to the previous stages, with more flowy terrain than Day 1 and a stronger backcountry feel compared to Day 2. Riders will navigate a dynamic mix of sandy, rooty, and gravelly surfaces, all while taking in breathtaking scenery. Insane scenery, insane racing, insane atmosphere The day starts and ends with amazing sunrise and sunset at Kaiteriteri Beach, recognized by TripAdvisor as one of the Top 10 beaches in the world. Participants can choose between the Regular Course, beginning with a scenic warm-up ride through coastal forest singletrack, or the Extended Course, which kicks off with a 30–45 minute climb offering spectacular views before rejoining the main route. The first stage plunges riders into a steep, technical descent, starting as an old-school, fast-and-loose track with multiple line choices and challenging ruts. Midway through, it transitions into a purpose-built singletrack featuring exciting whoops, turns, and technical features, culminating in a steep chute into a gully. From here, riders exit the park and follow the scenic Great Taste Trail to the shuttle pick-up. A 45-minute road shuttle, followed by a 20-minute off-road climb, takes them deep into Abel Tasman National Park, where an undulating 6km transition through stunning old-growth forest sets the stage for the final challenges of the day. Stages 2 & 3 wind through The Rameka Project , a reforestation and carbon-offset initiative dedicated to restoring native forests. The NZ MTB Rally is proud to partner with this project, purchasing carbon credits to fully offset the event’s direct and indirect emissions. It’s hard to understand how great each day's trails are. Just getting to Stage two was worth the journey on its own, but Stage 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 gave us nearly everything from solid high power grip to off-cambered powder.  It feels like every trail is the best ever — Stephen, 49, from Australia Everything was going fine until Sam Blenkinsop and Matt Walker started plotting and hid in a bush, waiting for Kilian Bron. Matt gave the green light for Sam to throw a rock at just the right moment, right into one of the spokes of his rear wheel. That same spoke then snuck into his cassette and decided to jam everything, forcing him to run the longest stage of the day. Well played, guys. Bravo True story (*except for the rock part, it came out of nowhere). Kilian lost valuable seconds in this incident, but still holds 3rd place in the overall ranking at the end of the day. With half the week still to go, it’s game on! Further along, the Historic Rameka Track treats riders to breathtaking views over Golden Bay before dropping them into a mix of high-speed traverses and tight, technical switchbacks. After a shuttle ride up Takaka Hill, the day continues on the newly completed Pikikirunga Trail —a fast and playful track, where skilled riders will need to judge their speed carefully over jumps and rollers. From here, the rally shifts gears with Mandini , a raw, steep, and untamed descent through native forest, rediscovered and reopened thanks to dedicated local trail builders. Passing through a private farm with special access, riders will get a glimpse of rural New Zealand before reaching The Riwaka Resurgence , a sacred Māori site where crystal-clear water emerges directly from the ground. A quick, icy dip here is an optional but refreshing reward for those brave enough! The final stage of the day, KarmaKaze-Treehugger, delivers a last dose of grippy, technical fun through the Kaiteriteri Bike Park The vibes are great. No one's here to show off, just good laughs all around. We take naps before every stage, and when it's time to go fast, we go all in! It's as simple as that. Such a great event — Kilian Bron, France Abel Tasman National Park is full of surprises! Riders then return to where it all began: the picturesque Kaiteriteri Beach, where they were greeted with a well-deserved swim & cold beverage, basking in the glow of the setting sun and reflecting on the day's achievements. Sam Blenkinsop still leading the overall ranking At the end of day 3, Zerode rider Sam Blenkinsop is still ahead. Matt Walker is now second, and Kilian third after his mechanical issues. Bring on Cable Bay! SAILING TO JURASSIC PARK - 6 stages // 26km // -2200m // +750m After a night in lodgings at Kaiteriteri Beach, racers were looking forward to an 80-minute cruise across to Cable Bay.  As the sun rose over Tasman Bay, riders gathered on the beach, boarding onto the sleek vessel that would carry them to the start of an epic day of riding. Riders embarked on an unforgettable journey, starting with a breathtaking sunrise boat cruise across Tasman Bay into the culturally significant Cable Bay (Rotokura). This pristine location holds deep importance to the Māori people, and participants were encouraged to respect the environment and acknowledge the guardianship of the local iwi. The catamaran crossing was a unique and scenic start to the day, adding to the rally’s adventure vibe, with breakfast and coffee served onboard to top off the experience. The journey across the water provided a moment of calm before the storm, allowing riders to soak in the beauty of the coastline and reflect on the past three intense days of racing. The relaxed atmosphere on board was filled with laughter and anticipation, as competitors exchanged stories and get excited about another big day of riding coming ahead. From the beach to Cable Bay Adventure Park is only a 20-minute warm-up ride on the road (and it's less than a 20-minute drive from Nelson city center). The park features an extensive and continually expanding network of trails, meticulously built and maintained by dedicated volunteers, gathering weekly to share their passion for great trails and riding. The park's trail system is primarily set within native forests, dense with towering tree ferns, podocarps, and black beech trees, creating a Jurassic Park-like atmosphere, but also within recent pine tree cultures, offering a wide diversity of terrain on the same day of riding! After the boat crossing, the riders headed to the first race stages of the day, shuttling and pedalling up to reach the best trails of the Bike Park. The terrain stepped up in both technicality and physical demand from previous days, requiring focus and skill. The loose and gravelly conditions demanded caution to avoid wheel washouts and unexpected tumbles. Cable Bay's feed station is now a classic of the Rally: amazing sea-views from the eagles-nest position, and delicious food, prepared and served with love from the proud staff at the park who gave riders another great example of warm kiwi hospitality Beyond the riding, the atmosphere was unbeatable. Cheering spectators, stunning panoramic ocean views, and a relaxed post-race vibe made the day feel more like an epic group ride than a competition. New rule for the last stage of the day for the top 4, Sam Blenkinsop, Kilian Bron, Matt Walker & Tuhoto Ariki: the timing doesn't stop when crossing the finish line, but only when they've finished drinking their ice-cold local craft beer! After an adrenaline-fueled day, riders capped off the event by celebrating with cold beers, food, and camaraderie at the finish. The river provided the perfect spot to cool off before shuttles departed for Nelson City, dropping riders at The Rutherford Hotel. From there, participants navigated to their accommodations for a well-deserved night of rest before the heli-day! Kilian Bron gets the best time of the day Sam Blenkinsop arrives 2nd in Cable Bay and is still leading the overall ranking after Day 4 As the NZ MTB Rally 2025 pushes past its midway point, the first four days have delivered an unforgettable mix of technical challenges, breathtaking landscapes, and true adventure riding. Every stage has pushed riders to their limits while rewarding them with some of the best mountain biking experiences New Zealand has to offer. The camaraderie among participants has only grown stronger, with shared moments of triumph, exhaustion, and exhilaration bringing together riders from across the globe. The catamaran crossing to Cable Bay on Day 4 was a highlight, reinforcing the rally’s unique approach to blending world-class riding with once-in-a-lifetime experiences. But the best is yet to come. Day 5 will take things to the next level with an unforgettable heli-drop into the legendary Wakamarina trail—an iconic descent packed with flowing singletrack, native beech forests, and high-speed technical sections. Then, the final day will bring the rally back to the heart of Nelson for a spectacular closing stage, where riders will push through one last day of incredible trails before crossing the finish line in celebration. With two epic days ahead, the NZ MTB Rally 2025 is set to end on a high note, cementing its reputation as one of the world’s most thrilling multi-day mountain biking events.

        "content": "Brose Sells E-Bike Division to Yamaha: Brose, the German manufacturer that provides e-bike motors for Specialized, SRAM, and others, has announced that it will be selling its e-bike drive business to Yamaha Motor Company. Brose's focus will shift to the automotive side (according to the company, every third new car is equipped with at least one Brose product), while the acquisition will increase Yamaha's ability to develop new products, and allow them to expand their footprint in Europe. Until this point, Yamaha wasn't one of the larger players in the eMTB market – their motors were found on bikes from Giant and a few other brands, but Bosch, Shimano, and Brose had much larger pieces of the pie. It will be interesting to see what changes this sale brings to the market once it's finalized. PRESS RELEASE: Brose SE is selling its e-bike drives business to Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. Subject to approval by the antitrust authorities, Yamaha's Motor eBike Systems GmbH will take over the e-bike drive and systems business. The sale is part of Brose's strategic realignment with a focus on its core business areas. In the future, Yamaha will use Brose's development resources in the e-bike sector to further optimize the planning and design of new products. At the same time, the company plans to establish its own development base in Europe to recognize market requirements more quickly, respond flexibly to local customer requests and win new customers. In addition, procurement in the key European market is to be strengthened and operational efficiency further improved. “We are convinced that Yamaha offers the best conditions to successfully develop the business further. At the same time, we would like to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication,” says Raymond Mutz, Executive Vice President Drives Brose Group. Both companies are working closely together to ensure a smooth transition phase."

        "content": "The Starling Dive is 26\", Steel and Single Pivot: PRESS RELEASE: Starling Cycles Just when you thought 26” was gone for good, Starling Cycles brings it diving back. The Starling Cycles Dive is a steel, full-suspension 26\" mountain bike. It's the ultimate retro-modern, old-school vs new-school combo. It has a handmade steel frame, timeless single-pivot suspension, loads of travel and the most iconic wheel size in MTB history. It's a tribute to the wheels we were all rocking when CDs were still spun, when Steve Peat was World Champ, when Josh Bender hucked the Jaw Drop, when VHS ruled the roost. No social media. No mobile phones. A golden age! AND, we're making a super limited batch of just 10 of them available during April, starting right now . Why 26\"? Because it still rips. Because life was simple on little wheels. Because the haters say our bikes are straight out of the 90s, so we thought \"f*ck it, let's just run with it!\". Why Dive? We called it the Dive, cos Joe spent his youth racing 26\" single-pivots and partying in Bristol's grungiest of dive bars. Those were good times. We realised those dive bars and 26” both have something in common. They were both a lot of fun, and we loved them, but we’re happy to have moved on into the future! But we also can’t resist a journey down memory lane, now and again! This super limited edition, throwback Starling was handmade in Bristol, UK. It would have been easy to just cheat and shove small wheels in a 'regular' Starling. But easy is boring, right? So we designed and made the Dive for real, creating a brand new 26\" Starling frame. It has all the modern Starling V3 DNA but rolls on 26-inch wheels for the riders who never stopped believing. It’s made with Reynolds 853 steel tubing and includes the various V3 features of Starling’s wider range, including that unique BB/pivot assembly, anti-flare headtube, UDH hanger and more. It has 160mm rear travel, room for big tyres and some up-to-date geo to keep it super-capable on our modern-day trails. We made it as a longish-travel, mini-downhill ripper. We all grew up riding downhill, dirt jumps, and 4X on 26,” so we wanted our revamp to revisit those vibes. We’ve also made the bike in a one-off IPA/Dark Lacquer raw finish. IPA is our raw, unpainted finish that doesn’t go rusty and will be available soon on all bikes. But this is all just an April fools, right? Nope! We’re building a limited run of 10 frames, available to order straight away from the Starling website as part of our RARE programme. If you want one, we’re making just 10 available with orders open right away. Orders close on the 1st May or when we've sold all 10, whichever comes first. You can see the full spec for the Starling Cycles Dive, and order online here. A huge thanks to our friends at the following brands for helping us build this special launch bike: - Hope Technology - Fox Suspension (Via Silverfish) - Schwalbe - Bike Yoke - Renthal The bike is built with Hope 's 26\" Fortus wheels and Schwalbe 26\" Magic Mary tyres. 170mm travel 26\" fork options were like Unicorn's eggs, so we opted for a 27.5\" Fox 38 up front, and a coil DHX2 on the rear. Hope covered the bike in UK-made bike jewellery, supplying brakes, drivetrain, headset, valves, seat clamp and pedals. All in red, cos we all swore red bikes were faster back in the day. Renthal supplied a Fatbar and their awesome Traction lock-on grips. The seat post came from BikeYoke and the saddle from Fizik . Gears are 10-speed Shimano Saint, cos life was better with fewer cogs!

        "content": "2025 Red Bull Tennessee National: Dogs of Windrock & Randoms: In case you didn't know where we are. Tennessee Nationals 2025 is in the books, and wow, did it ever deliver. I had the pleasure of coming up for finals day, which had some gloomy, wet weather in the forecast. For most of practice, track conditions were primo, but sure enough, come race time, the rain came down and turned the Tennessee clay into ultra-slippery mud. Despite the slick conditions, riders rose to the challenge and tamed the brutal track. The juniors had it the worst, as the mud tacked up ever so slightly for the pros. In the pro women’s field, Aletha Ostgaard from Canyon took the win by a four-second margin, followed by Marine Cabirou in second and Lisa Baumann in third. In the pro men’s race, Amaury Pierron held it down through a slippery run to take the win, followed closely by Till Alran and Troy Brosnan in second and third. One of the highlights for me was the number of rad dogs rolling around, so I snapped plenty of pics of all the good boys and girls I saw on course. I also thoroughly enjoyed the number of dirt bikes roaming around and the southern hospitality. Thanks for the good times, Windrock. Enjoy some event randoms (but mostly dogs) from the day. Tools of the trade. There are a lot of Frameworks rolling around these parts. Carbon rear end on this Frameworks trail bike. One of many incredible dogs. Crestline crew getting things dialed in before finals. Big dog. Up we go. Rock work is incredible. This dog kind of blends in with the Tennessee dirt. Ruts were forming nicely during practice. Gwinner. This was on a trail next to the race course, pretty cool woodwork. Pupper. The dogs were also enjoying the racing action. Big cheezin'. Big dog. Lil dog. 2 for 1 dogs. The pose. This was off the side of the walkway... Top dog on the podium. More dog. This seems like a pose. Canyon was testing something new. Dak’s very well behaved dog. Southern Gravity's DH rig, built just down the street. A little hand eye prep tossin' the pig skin. Self explanatory. A little bit of a rarer find around these parts. This dog has spunk. 100's everywhere. Very rad. A moody course just before finals. And the rains came... Another good dog. This was a very well-behaved dog. The rains made this section a slip and slide. This guy loved the chaos ensuing. Best hair doo went to this dog. Peanut butter type of mud. Precious. Would you? Line-ups for the bike wash post race. This is just too much. One more for this good boy. Pro Women’s podium. Amaury with his new hardware. Pro Men's Podium Gotta love the budget tailgate pad."

Brendan Fairclough wouldn’t miss it for the world—it's one of the highlights of his year. Taking a trip to South Africa is about more than just big hits and adrenaline at the Darkfest compound. There’s so much more to explore. Local legend Andrew Neethling is always up for showing Brendan freshly built trails, making sure there’s no shortage of new lines to ride aboard the SCOTT Voltage. There is nothing quite like showing your local to your friends. For Andrew, \"Riding with Brendan on my home trails brings back so many good memories from my racing days. It a little different as I feel the need to push myself a little harder which is a good thing and exciting. Keeps me on my toes.\" The power of Photoshop Andrew is clear on the impact the Voltage has made to his riding habits \"There is no question I ride way more since I got my Voltage. Pushes me to go out more times a week and so fun to just sneak in more laps, even more true in the busy Darkfest week.\" Full focus to throw the best whip The calm Brendan is always motivated to join Andrew in South Africa—the riding potential keeps growing every year, and he definitely benefits from Andrew's knowledge. “I don’t need a sighting lap,” he says. “I can just drop in behind Andrew and follow his line. Since he helped build the trails, you can always trust that the landing or corner will be exactly where it needs to be.\" Photos by Sven Martin Video by Retroyspective"

        "content": "Review: Polygon Collosus DH-R - Smooth & Sensibly Priced: Polygon has been known for making some wild-looking bikes. Remember their old Xquare One DH bike ? The silhouette of the new Collosus is slightly less radical, except it uses a multitude of short links. Polygon calls this their Independent Floating Suspension (IFS) - the same 6-bar design found on their N9 enduro bike . The new Collosus has already been in action at events like Red Bull Rampage and World Cup Downhill races, not to mention being prominently displayed at Sea Otter last year . Two alloy-framed models start off with the DH-M at $3,499 USD. The DH-R model receives Fox Factory suspension and dependable DT Swiss wheels for $4,999, which is one hell of a deal. Balanced geometry, smooth kinematics, and strong brakes set the foundation of a quality downhill bike, which is what the Collosus strives for, but one specification was skimped on both options: sticky tires. Collosus Details • 200 mm travel, 203 mm fork • Alloy frame • 29 or MX wheels • IFS 6-link suspension • 62.6-63° head angle • 445 mm chainstays • Sizes: S, M (tested), L, XL • 10-year frame warranty • Weight: 17.7 kg / 39.0 lb • Pricing: $3,499- 4,999 USD • More info: polygonbikes.com Contents Introduction Construction & Features Suspension Design Geometry & Sizing Setup Performance Value How Does it Compare?

        "content": "The Tripping Balls is a Steel Gearbox-Equipped Trail Bike with a Fresh Canfield Kinematic - Taipei Cycle Show 2025: Stevie Lin is at the Taipei Cycle Show this week presenting an absolute belter of a one-off - the Tripping Balls. It's a gearbox-equipped steel trail bike adaptable to run an MX or 29\" wheelset, with the capacity to run the rear wheel travel between 145mm and 160mm. It delivers that travel through a twin-link suspension linkage designed by Chris Canfield (of Canfield Bikes and most recently, Vampire Bikes). Based out of Taiwan, Stevie has been working in the bike industry for over 20 years helping the big brands access some of the best carbon and aluminum frame factories here. The Tripping Balls frame is a passion project for Stevie, something he has developed just for himself. However, should there be sufficient appetite for it he is also considering running a small batch of production bikes in the region of 20-30 frames. Stevie is 174 cm tall. The frame has a reach of 455mm and a chainstay length to match, with a 64° head angle and a 77.5° seat angle. The frame is fabricated from 4130 CrMo steel with a unique dropout construction on the drive-side. The stays of the swingarm are actually two separate pieces, though of course they do not articulate about one another near the dropout. The separate drop-out piece is bolted to each stay individually so that it can slide out to allow the gearbox belt into the rear triangle. It's a neat solution. The shock tab has two mounting positions for the shock allowing the frame to run a 27.5\" or a 29\" rear wheel. Stevie plans to run this as a 29\" trail bike on the shorter-travel end of the spectrum to suit the trails in Taiwan. With an Ohlins coil shock he can run a 230mm eye-to-eye and the shock stroke between 55mm and 62.5mm giving a range of 145mm to 160mm. The swingarm is braced in three places; just north of and just south of the lowermost pivot, and again at the seat stay. The latter is a bolt-on affair. It can be removed to allow the necessary clearance if running the bike in a long travel setting. Chris Canfield, inventor of the CBF and CF3 suspension platforms (among others), developed the kinematic for the bike. We will update this article when we get further details on it from Chris. Oh, and there's that obligatory bottle opener on the NDS of the shock tab. One must never risk developing a dreuth . Perish the thought. P.S.: Actually there are two, one on each side. Cable routing will be external; the port on the NDS is routing for a cable for the Pinion C-Line gearbox, of which there are 9s and 12s versions to choose from. Last but not least, that crank is from a company called Renegade that is making short aftermarket cranks for Pinion gearboxes. This is a CNC machined prototype but the production run with be forged to bring a lower price point option to the market in 155mm, 160mm, and 165mm lengths."

        "content": "A $7000 Truing Stand & More Tools - Taipei Cycle Show 2025: BERD Spokes are showing off TRUDI, their electronic-assist truing stand that retails at $7,000 USD. Astonishingly expensive, I know. But, the claim from BERD is that this truing stand can turn anyone; a cleaner, an accountant, a professional wind surfer, a Pirate of the Caribbean, into a professional wheel truer, overnight. With a tensiometer, lateral and radial sensors, TRUDI guides the user through a series of steps to a point where the wheel is true, laterally and radially. Key to the TRUDI stand is the automated spoke drill. After measuring the tension in each of the spokes, the system is programmed to give each individual spoke nipple the pre-determined number of turns needed to true the wheel. BERD tell us that often only a single pass is required, but some times two passes are needed to get the wheel closer to perfection. All the system needs to know is the rim type (carbon or aluminum), the spoke length and material, and the number of spokes. The user actually requires no knowledge of wheel technology whatsoever. At the moment, the system is limited to working with steel spokes, though an update for carbon spokes is under development. Even more interesting perhaps is the new outside drill that is in development (not shown). This version of the automated drill will turn the spoke nipples from the hub side, so you won’t even need to remove the tire from the rim. BERD are making the TRUDI system available to anyone. Of course, manufacturers and high-throughput wheel building workshops stand to benefit most. At $7,000 USD, you'd need to be a real enthusiast to fork out for this system as a home mechanic. And, chances are, if you're that enthusiastic you're already truing your own wheels and don't need the help of this technology. Topeak are showing their new Team Issue prep station which goes for $1,299 USD. That money fetches you the concertina-style pivoting shelving unit, and all of the tools inside it. It is impressively compact and portable, with a handle that allows you to wheel it around like a suit case. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Pulling up on the handle to expand the shelves is very clunky as they don't slide along the shaft very well. It's awkward, and would be better off if it were constructed from a lower friction polymer. If you've been thinking that the bike industry was clean out of fresh ideas, think again. Muc-Off is here to put those fears to bed with It Blows! the Precision Air Blaster. Why wipe your frame down when you can blow dry it instead? Cloths are so last year. Get one for £120 / €150 / $150 USD. On a more serious note Muc-Off is also showing their very compact tire inflator, the Air Mach Electric Mini Inflator Pro. Its dimensions are as follows: 64mm  x 56mm x 28mm. It comes with a small hose and will work with both Presta and Schrader valves. We are told it can inflate two 29\" tires on a full charge. It weighs a claimed 97 grams. The maximum pressure is 120 psi, so it should be good for road as well as MTB."

Check out the highlights! A whole week of just some of the funniest riding I’ve done — Sam Blenkinsop, Zerode The final two days of the NZ MTB Rally 2025 delivered everything riders had hoped for—and more. After four days of relentless adventure, the rally reached its peak with a breathtaking heli-drop into Wakamarina on Day 5, followed by a thrilling closing stage around Nelson on Day 6. From remote back-country descents to world-class singletrack, the last stages cemented this year’s event as one for the history books. HELI DROP into NZ Bacountry 3 stages // -1350m // +475m This is the day everyone was expecting, yet somehow it was even better than expected On this penultimate day of the race, we headed for Marlborough to tackle its formidable 'Wakamarina' backcountry trails. On the program: a helicopter drop-off at the summit to explore these lush forests, offering a crazy diversity of landscapes and terrain. Black beeches (not beaches!), crystal clear rivers, huge ferns, and roots galore. After an hour on the bus and 8km of cruisy pedaling, racers loaded up 5-per-heli to embark for the drop-point at the Department of Conservation's 'Foster's Hut', nestled in a saddle near to the summit of the fabled Wakamarina Trail. When we say 'helipad', what we actually mean is the corner of a DOC camping field. At least one unsuspecting Kiwi was rudely awakened by the thud of helicopter blades as the first chopper came in to land. As the NZ MTB Rally nears its grand finale, riders faced one of the most exhilarating and rewarding days of the event. The adventure began high in the Richmond Ranges, where a helicopter drop delivered them straight into pristine backcountry. From the very first pedal stroke, they were immersed in a world of untouched singletrack, lush native forest, and flowing descents that tested both skill and endurance. Zerode Riders, Sam Blenkinsop & Tuhoto Ariki Pene enjoying the buzz of a high-adrenaline Heli-drop deep into Marlborough's mountainous backcountry terrain Dropping-in to the first stage of the day and which started directly out of the helicopter. Insane scenes indeed: the stoke at the start-line today was off the scale! Stage 1 was fast and full of cornflakes. Raced blind (as per all NZ RALLY Stages) it was mostly a test of who's prepared to simply open the taps and hang on for the wild white-knuckle ride. The liaison between SP1 and SP2 was one of the hardest of the week, requiring racers to push or, on occasion, carry their bike. Definitely not the best day to \"enjoy\" an E-bike ! But the effort was well worth the reward, given the treasures yet to be revealed on the next two stages. That was definitely one of those days that put a smile on your face for a long time! Kilian Bron didn't fly up to the Fosters Hut. He and his girlfriend Kim, climbed up there at the end of day 4 to pass the night the kiwi way: enjoying the sounds of the native forest and a cosy fire in the Hut. Apparently, this is the secret to victory, because Kilian gets the best time of the day, 50 seconds ahead of Matt Walker in second. Sam Blenkinsop and Tuhoto Ariki Pene stuck together on the stages to shoot some nice GoPro runs and end up 4th and 5th. But Sam is still leading the overall ranking! Racing Right out of the City Centre 5 stages // 31km // -2150m // +710m All the riders set off directly from the heart of Nelson, leaving The Rutherford Hotel after breakfast to embark on one last journey through Nelson's stunning backcountry. With the city’s incredible trails right on the doorstep, the final day was a perfect mix of adrenaline, challenge, and pure riding joy. Designed in part as a showcase for the incredible and easily-accessible riding in the region, the organisers were keen to start and finish the day literally from the city centre. They were also joined by 30 \"Wild-card\" local riders invited only for this last day to add some spice along with a few Nelsonian 'Yeah-Boi's' to round off the week. The day began with a smooth transition across town to the historical Coppermine climbing trail, a steady ascent that led riders into the first exhilarating descent of the day—Turners. This fast, flowing trail featured berms, optional jumps, and smooth lines, allowing riders to carve their way down in style before transitioning into the next challenge. A fun, off-the-clock jump line encouraged participants to ride together and showcase their best tricks, with media capturing every airborne moment. The ride continued with a shuttle lift to Nelson’s Fringed Hill, where those taking on the extended course climbed even higher to experience the rugged beauty of Black Diamond Ridge, Sunrise Ridge, and Peaking Ridge. These technical sections pushed riders to their limits, with steep root-infested descents and rocky terrain demanding skill and control. Peaking Ridge, a local favourite, delivered an unforgettable mix of flow and challenge, rewarding those who embraced its twists and drops. It's definitely the kind of event that i like, if you want to race, you race, if you want to enjoy a good time with your friend you can do it too, and if you want to do both, it's the perfect place!\" — Kilian Bron, France After regrouping and refueling, riders faced the final two epic descents of the rally. The legendary Te Ara Koa, New Zealand’s longest dedicated mountain bike trail, provided a thrilling mix of technical features, tight corners, and fast, flowy sections. The trail’s natural terrain kept riders engaged, with marked lines ensuring a safe but exhilarating ride to the valley below. To cap off the week, riders tackled Hotbox, a freshly refurbished classic, blending rooty, hand-cut sections with newly sculpted machine-built corners, making for an exciting final stage. As the last finishers rolled in, cheers erupted along the riverside, where the day concluded with cold drinks, snacks, and a well-deserved swim in a pristine natural pool. It’s always been on the bucket list of mine and then any reason to come to Nelson for me is a good reason so I always love coming to race and ride here — Sam Blenkinsop, Zerode The event wrapped up with a big party, split between a great dinner, award ceremony, storytelling, and celebration, marking the end of a truly extraordinary week of mountain biking. The podium party went wild (again) The NZ MTB Rally is more than just a race—it’s an adventure, a journey, and a celebration of mountain biking. Over the past six days, riders from around the world have pushed their limits, forged new friendships, and experienced some of the best trails New Zealand has to offer. The final evening was a time to reflect, with a closing ceremony filled with laughter, stories, and well-earned cheers for everyone who took part. With the 2025 edition now in the books, one thing is certain—the NZ MTB Rally continues to set the standard for multi-day mountain biking events. Until next time, keep riding, keep exploring, and keep the adventure alive, and we’ll see you on the trails again soon. BREAKING NEWS - NZ MTB Rally organisers will be offering tour packages in 2026 following the same itinerary as the Race, but in a relaxed, non-raced, fully-supported format.

        "content": "Race Report: Shimano Volcanic Epic Stage 1: Words: Volcanic Epic Excitement was palpable today as over 260 mountain bikers, representing over 18 nationalities, started the five-day-long Shimano Volcanic Epic MTB Stage Race, based in Rotorua, New Zealand. Now in its third year, the multi-day event showcases the world-class singletrack trails of the geothermal plateau, this year featuring 182kilometers of the best of Rotorua and Taupō. Today was Stage 1, a 21km introduction to the Whakarewarewa Forest and awarding the first leaders of the race, who are awarded the yellow Tineli leaders jerseys. “We’ve been to New Zealand a couple of times, mainly for bike-related adventures.” Said Em Viotto, half of the returning Australian Pairs team Shimano Cycle Co-Op, with Karl Michelin-Beard.  “This event is really different to others. The stages are shorter, giving us time to explore the local areas”. Ride, relax, repeat is the mantra - with each day’s racing done by early afternoon, riders are then free to explore the region's sights and delights – a real bonus for those who’ve travelled from overseas with friends and family. “That was so much fun, that dirt is hero dirt the whole way - I had a blast!” said Sean Cassily from New Mexico, USA. Sean is riding alongside his wife Susie and 15-year-old son, Col, who is riding in the 2-Day event at the weekend. “It’s our first time in New Zealand, we have some great travels, met so many cool people, and had some great riding up until now. We love this place.” Some riders are on a quest to find the worlds best MTB races, like USA professional mountain bikers and YouTube stars, Syd Schulz & Macky Franklin “We’ve been to New Zealand three times, exploring and racing the Enduro World Series” said Macky “We heard great things about Volcanic Epic and had to check it out”. Today’s leaders include the Masters Men Pairs team, Volcanic Steamers 3.0. Teammates Dan Boulton and & Mark Johnston (Nelson, NZ) arrived back today from tackling eight days of riding at South Africa’s Absa Cape Epic. Tomorrow’s Stage 2 is where the race really starts, with a loop course in Rotorua’s Whakarewarewa Forest. The following three days include native forests of the Western Ōkataina Walkway, Taupō’ Craters MTB Park, and return to Rotorua, starting at the beautiful Te Puia.

        "content": "Video: Fergus Ryan Rides the New Trailcat LT in 'The Goodfella': Words: Fergus Ryan Pivot’s latest release, the Trail Cat, is designed to outdo its predecessor, offering riders the ability to conquer steeper gradients without sacrificing the signature trail bike feel that shorter travel bikes are known for. Forest of Dean local Fergus Ryan took the Trail Cat to three contrasting locations with one goal in mind: to give the bike a thrashing on true British trails. Nestled in the South Wales countryside, some of the UK’s most scenic and exciting trails provide the perfect testing ground for the Trail Cat LT. With perfectly crafted berms and fun side hits, it was an ideal playground for this bike. Riding a bike that’s lightweight on the climbs but stable and responsive on the descents is incredible. The shorter rear end, combined with a generous reach, gave me so much confidence to push hard on different features. Next, Fergus and the team headed to Mid Wales, where they encountered some truly rugged conditions. Snow-capped hills greeted them at 6 a.m.—not quite what they had expected—but the panoramic views from the top made the challenging ascent worthwhile. Riding on frozen single track and blasting down a grassy hillside was epic. The following day, the team returned to Ferg's locals in the Forest of Dean. With heavy rain and varied terrain, they experienced the best—and sometimes the worst—of British winter. Foggy woodlands and deep ruts didn’t stop the smiles. For me, having a bike that I can ride with confidence in a real variety of conditions is key. We have such a variety of terrains and weather in the UK, meaning that having a bike that gives a consistent feel is super important. The Trail cat has really hit the mark!"

        "author": "Dario DiGiulio",
        "date": "03-31-2025",
        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-foxs-fully-redesigned-x2-and-dhx2.html",
        "content": "First Ride: Fox's Fully Redesigned X2 & DHX2 Shocks: The Fox X2 was the definitive gravity air shock for quite some time, but as competitors popped up and durability concerns plagued some riders, the big shock was due for a reboot. The past few years have seen some iterative updates to the X2, but this year marks a full-fledged overhaul. With a completely different damping architecture, a larger air chamber, and more adjustability than before, Fox's big air shock has been fully revamped - along with its coil counterpart. The DHX2 shares the same internal architecture with the new X2, but remains optimized for fans of the linear coil feel. X2 Details • Intended use: enduro, DH, eMTB • Monotube architecture • 4-way external adjustment • Larger main shaft diameter • X2 Weight: 784g (230x65mm, bearing mount) • DHX2 Weight: 944g (230x65mm, bearing & 450# spring) • X2 Price: $699-739 USD / $939-989 CAD / €939- 989 EUR / 1199-1299 AUS • DHX2 Price: $679-719 USD / $899-959 CAD / €909 - 959 EUR / 1199-1249 AUS • ridefox.com The new guts. Features & Adjustments Like the outgoing X2, the new model features externally adjustable high and low speed compression and rebound - according to Fox these are the world's first monotube mountain bike shocks to offer all of those external adjustments. Both the X2 and DHX2 feature the following adjustments for the Factory and Performance Elite models. 8 clicks High speed compression | 16 clicks Low speed compression | 8 clicks High speed rebound | 16 clicks Low speed rebound | optional Firm mode The Performance models see one less external adjuster, but still feature the optional climb switch. 8 clicks High speed compression | 16 clicks Low speed compression | 16 clicks Low speed rebound | optional Firm mode While the X2's air pressure is easily honed in to hit your sag target, the DHX2 is offered in 25lb and 50lb spring increments to suit your bike and rider weight. The X2's air volume is adjustable in 1cc increments, up to 16cc, with a maximum air pressure of 350psi. On the topic of adjustability, I pinged Fox's Ariel Lindsley to dig a bit deeper on how the new shocks can be suited to a given bike and rider. It seems like Float X has taken up a decent bit of the OE market, partially due to the extremely wide range of tuning options you can achieve with that shock. Does the new X2 compete in that same space, or is the adjustability still more focused on smaller end-user changes? Essentially we have just as broad of a range of internal tunes for DHX2 and Float X2 as with Float X and DHX - both on compression and rebound. The difference with these two shocks is with the four way adjustability you can get yourself all the way to the next step stiffer or lighter tune by using the external adjusters. This gives the user a lot more flexibility to tailor their bike to their needs without having to get someone to revalve it internally. I also recall you mentioning that the VVC assembly procedure has changed slightly, does that do anything to the high speed outputs or is it just to achieve more consistent builds? Basically we were able to just simplify the process of how to set the VVC when rebuilding or revalving a shock. Probably not something that most people will be involved with. However for those who are digging in at that level it makes the process much simpler. We did find a clever way to make the high speed adjuster have more close to perfect increments between clicks. It was a nice improvement that I think users of these shocks will appreciate. The previous rebuild process on the VVC internals (which effect both high speed circuits) required some very complex tooling to complete consistently, so a simplified process in this camp should be very welcome by anyone regularly servicing the X2 or DHX2. As to why they moved from the twin tube design to a simpler monotube architecture, Fox claimed the following: Pressure balancing was required to meet the goal of achieving equivalent performance of the GRIP X2 damper. With greater control of the shock’s rebound stroke, the rear tire behaves with more predictability, which leads to greater rider confidence. The twin tube architecture of the previous FLOAT X2 did not meet the requirements for pressure balancing, so we moved to a monotube design. This also gave us opportunity to upgrade the main shaft diameter from 3/8” (9.5mm) to ½” (12.7mm) for even more strength and durability. However, the move to monotube made preserving 4-way adjustability a challenge. That 4-way adjustability was achieved by locating both high- and low-speed rebound at the base of the shock, with a set of internal worm gears that allow you to adjust the low-speed's needle and orifice and the high-speed's VVC base plate independently. Another upside to the monotube architecture over the previous twin-tube design comes down to friction. Cutting the number of check valves in half and reducing the size of the main seal play big roles here, making for a shock that should break into its travel and rebounds more freely. Add to that the durability benefits, reduction in risk of cavitation, and lack of oil aeration, and the change makes a lot of sense. Pricing & Availability The X2 and DHX2 are both available in a bevy of sizes, with a large library of internal tune options as mentioned above. Finding the right tune for your bike will involve either contacting the bike brand in question to get a sense of which will best suit your model, or by trying a variety of tunes yourself to suss out which best suits your use case. Eyelet shock sizing:  210x50 | 210x52.5 | 210x55 | 230x60 | 230x62.5 | 230x65 | 250x75 Trunnion shock sizing: 185x55 | 205x60 | 205x65 | 225x75 As with all Fox suspension products, there are three tiers to the lineup: Performance, Performance Elite, and Factory. The latter two categories get 4-way adjustability, with Performance omitting high-speed rebound. The price ranges for the X2 and DHX2 are as follows. Float X2: $699-739 USD / $939-989 CAD / €939- 989 EUR / 1199-1299 AUS DHX2: $679-719 USD / $899-959 CAD / €909-959 EUR / 1199-1249 AUS Ride Impressions Both of these shocks have spent time on my Frameworks enduro bike, which runs a 230x65mm shock to deliver 170mm of rear wheel travel. I also tried the X2 in a reduced stroke length on a Santa Cruz Hightower, to get a sense of how far you can compensate using the external adjustments on tap. Obviously a shock with a specific tune tested and chosen by the manufacturer is going to be the best setup for most cases, but I was impressed with how far you can take the shock with clickers alone. Neither the X2 or DHX2 have seen enough time to comment on durability or wide-ranging conditions, but initial impressions are positive. The adjustments are meaningful, the damping transition between compression and rebound is smooth, and both shocks are fairly quiet - though not silent if you're used to the mute RockShox dampers. Despite riding some moves that often generate noticeable bottom-outs, and the DHX2's lack of a hydraulic bottom-out circuit, I haven't found any harsh sensations at the end of travel. More credit might be owed to the bike than the shock in this camp, but until I have the opportunity to ride the shocks on a more linear bike this will have to suffice. More importantly, I've been able to balance support and feedback to suit the feel I want out of the bike, without any major concessions so far. After many more miles, some different tunes, and plenty of back-to-backs with other top shocks on the market, I'll be back here with a full-fledged review."

        "content": "Race Report: Shimano Volcanic Epic Stage 2: Words: Shimano Volcanic Epic Thursday saw over 260 mountain bikers from around the world tackled the Queen Stage of the Shimano Volcanic Epic MTB Race, in Rotorua New Zealand. The Queen Stage title goes to the event’s longest day of 57km with the biggest climbs of nearly 2,000m. But what goes up must come down, with the course featuring some of the best descents in the Whakarewarewa Forest’s 200 km+ of world-class singletrack. Before the horn went to start the day’s racing, Macky Franklin, one half of USA professional mountain bikers and YouTubers, Syd & Macky, represented the participants at a pōwhiri - a traditional Māori challenge to test the intentions of these visitors. With the offering accepted, Macky and the rangatira or chief shook hands and shared a hongi. Macky Franklin, USA, represents visiting riders at the morning's wero, with a handshake and hongi before heading out onto the longest course of the event. The Shimano Volcanic Epic MTB Stage Race, presented by Tineli, is New Zealand’s premier multi-day bike race showcasing the very best trails of the North Island’s geothermal plateau. Riders representing over 18 nationalities are taking part, racing each morning before relaxing the afternoons, exploring the region's attractions - many extending their visits either side of the event. Described as 'epic', 'tough' and 'beautiful' with nearly 2,000m of climbing and almost entirely singletrack, riders couldn't switch off for a moment on the Queen Stage of the Shimano Volcanic Epic “It’s just an amazing race,” said Benno Heussi, from Switzerland. “All these trails, the friendly people, I love it so much to be here in New Zealand.” Heussi and partner Manuela Kaufmann are back again for their second Volcanic Epic. First time racing is an exciting prospect, but Heussi was returning with lessons learnt. “Last year I blew up in the prologue,” he recalled, “And today I’ve done better pacing. Now a second time I know the race better, not so nervous and really enjoy it.” While the event is competitive, it’s also social, with friends new and old, said Heussi, who met up with team The Pool Boys, whom he met in 2024. “We made friends last year, and one week ago we did the Timber Trail in Taupō together. It’s a great opportunity, when you’re in New Zealand, to mountain bike such a great trail in the native forest, and we did it together with friends from last year, which makes it even more special.” Pairs team PURE Sports Nutrition cross the finish line with big smiles after their biggest day out on the bikes at the Shimano Volcanic Epic MTB Stage Race. From passionate riders to the elites, fresh from his elite men's win at the 2025 Oceania Mountain Bike Championships, Australian Sam Fox took the Solo Open Men’s leader jersey from Stage 1’s winner, Connor Johnston. Fox said he put the gas on for the first climb, managing to lose Johnston for the rest of the race and finishing 3 minutes up. “I just tried to really press on the pedals and open the gap up before we got into the tight twisty stuff, because he’s got that local knowledge”, but it wasn’t a cake walk after 57km says Fox “it turned into a bit of a blur eventually, I wasn’t too sure where I was or who I was out there”. It was a tight battle for the eBike Solos between Stefan Grant and Stephen Gray. “He was so close, it just sucks he crashed on one of the corners” said Grant “ I waited until he got back up, but later on he made a mistake and I passed him.” Gray crossed 3 minutes later, with a big smile to explain what happened. “There was a high line and a low line, and I didn’t take either,” said Gray and commended his rival for the camaraderie. “It was a mean ride, he was on me and didn’t let up. He’s a quality human.” Team Shimano Cycling Co-Op climb strong together on a new climbing trail at Rotorua's Whakarewarewa Forest as part of the Shimano Volcanic Epic. One of the appeals of stage races like the Shimano Volcanic Epic is the ability to ride in a Pair team, mixing it up any way you like. This year teams include father & sons, partners, friends and more. “It makes a huge difference to your experience of the race,” says Gav McCarthy, one half of Pedal Cartel Cycling/MyRide Wellington with Laura Park. “Yeah, do it, it’s good fun. Someone’s going to be faster, you just deal with it.” Park added her advice to aspiring teams: “Pick your best riding buddy, just fun like you usually do, and it’ll make for a great week.” Tomorrow’s Stage 3 starts out at the stunning Lake Rotoiti, taking riders on the native forests and challenging backcountry trails of the Western Ōkataina Walkway. Stage 4 welcomes the 2 Day riders at Taupō’s Craters MTB Park, before returning to Rotorua for Stage 5, starting at Te Puia, home of the southern hemisphere's largest geyser.

        "content": "Race Report: Pan Am DH 2025 - The Most Intense Battle Yet: PAN AM DH 2025: The Most Intense Battle Yet photography & words: // Diego del Rio The 2025 Pan American Downhill Championships, held from March 20 to 23 at the AraucaníaDH Bikepark in Temuco, Chile, marked a new chapter for MTB in the Americas. With over 500 riders from across the continent, this event not only drew massive participation but also showcased an unprecedented level of competition. World-class riders pushed the limits, making this one of the most memorable Pan Ams in history. The top categories delivered thrilling performances. In Elite Men, Chilean Alvaro Martinez claimed gold with a time of 03:24.645, followed closely by Sebastian Holguin with one second more, 03:25.644 and Roger Vieira with 03:26.140. These riders navigated the demanding course with precision, leaving no room for error. On the women’s side, Chilean Paz Gallo dominated with a time of 03:53.433, outperforming former Junior World Champ Valentina Roa with 03:53.433 and Canadian Andreane Lanthier with 03:58.645. The level of competition in this category was fierce, showcasing the growing talent pool in women's downhill. Rising star Brazilian Augusto Wening took the win in the Junior Men category with a time of 03:28.305, demonstrating immense potential for future international competition. Experienced veterans like Santiago de Santiago in Master A and local legend Antonio Leiva in B1 proved they still have the speed and skill to compete at the highest level, drawing admiration from younger riders. Many are calling this Pan Am the most competitive in history. With world-class athletes, including riders regularly seen on the World Cup circuit, the intensity was undeniable. The presence of elite-level talent like Sebastian Holguin, Mark Wallace, Roger and Douglas Vieira, Valentina Roa and Andreane Lanthier not only raised the bar but also highlighted the rapid growth of DH in the Americas. It’s clear that this region is no longer an underdog but a legitimate force on the global stage. The course on Cerro Pangal is notorious for its technical sections, steep drops, and high-speed lines. The first days of practice saw wet and muddy conditions, making it difficult for riders to connect sections smoothly. As the weather improved, the trail, now hammered by over 500 riders, became a chaotic mix of slick, slippery patches beneath the lush eucalyptus forest and dry, blown-out sections that punished mistakes. This constant mutation of the track not only tested the technical ability of the riders but also their mental toughness. For the first time in Pan Am history, a proper qualifying system with rider eliminations was implemented. This step towards a more rigorous format brought a new level of professionalism to the event. The fact that not everyone made it to the final added weight to each run, creating a high-stakes atmosphere that kept riders and spectators on edge. Riders had to balance pushing their limits with maintaining control — a delicate line that only the best could master. After a long wait — the last Pan American Championships on Chilean soil were back in 2018 — the host country made a statement. Chilean riders took advantage of their home track, securing podiums in multiple categories and proving that the nation's downhill scene is thriving. The victory of Alvaro Martinez in Elite Men’s and Paz Gallo in Elite Women's was a proud moment for local fans and a testament to the dedication and growth of the sport in Chile. The 2025 Pan American Downhill Championships in Temuco have set a new benchmark for competitive MTB in the Americas. As the UCI rolls out stricter regulations for participation starting this year, these continental championships are set to become even more crucial for athletes aiming to compete at the highest levels. Riders now need to secure points and rankings through these events to qualify for World Cups, making the Pan Ams a pivotal battleground for those seeking to make their mark on the global stage. The region’s growth and professionalism in the sport are undeniable, and it’s time for global bike brands to take notice. With talent on par with the best in the world and a hunger for progression, South American DH is no longer just a growing scene — it’s a powerhouse demanding recognition. It’s not just the riders who are raising the bar—America’s downhill scene is growing in every aspect.

        "content": "Final Randoms - Taipei Cycle Show 2025: Wild Force won an award at Taipei Cycle this year for its Booster Crank. The crankset features an extender that offsets the pedal axle from the end of the crank arm, giving the illusion that the crank length, and therefore leverage, is increased between 12 and 6 o'clock, reaching its peak at 3 o'clock. The brand claims that the design is able to increase pedaling force by 50%. Needless to say, this was met with heavy skepticism. My colleague Seb Stott distilled it rather succinctly. There is no increased leverage, and therefore no increase in torque, despite the actual distance between the pedal axle and the bottom bracket being longer at 3 o'clock. As you can see in the video, the crank extension piece counter-rotates relative to the crank rotation, offsetting any increase in leverage. What we can say about this crankset is that it effectively moves your bottom bracket position forward giving a slacker effective seat tube angle and an increased risk of toe overlap. It will also be subject to efficiency losses through the gearing that is present inside the crank arm that works to keep the extension portion of the crank level with the ground throughout a full rotation. Funn MTB now has a 35mm option for the Upturn bar available in three different rise options: 50mm, 55mm and 75mm. It retails at $67.90 USD and weighs a claimed 405 grams in the 75mm option. Funn is also showing its Ripper 2 pedals for enduro; a single-sided and a dual-sided clip option going for $149 and $159 USD, respectively. The single-sided weighs a claimed 428 grams for the pair, while the dual-sided option weighs a claimed 505 grams. The central SPD portion rotates up to 15 degrees on the central axle to allow the rider to clip-in more easily. Goodyear has new versions of its Escape tire - the Escape Max in Trail Plus casing with the Grip 2 Compound, and the Escape Inter in the Trail Lite casing with the UHP compound. Ritchey has new flat pedals called the Big Foot. It consist of a 105mm x 108.5mm nylon body on a CrMo axle, with nine bottom-loading replaceable pins on each side. It is 18.5mm thick and it weighs a claimed 360 grams. Available in black or mojave. Quai wheels are showing their Enduro 33 carbon wheelset with an eye-catching rim profile. The rim bed is raised where it accommodates spoke nipples pertaining to the disc side on this front wheel, and depressed where it accommodates spokes from the drive side. This is said to allow them to better balance the spoke tension between sides. The Enduro 33 wheelset weighs a claimed 1,870 grams in 29\", and retails at $1,299 USD. Granite Design are showing off some new trailside repair tools, the Suture and Suture Aero. The former is simply a tire plugging tool inside a machined tube stuffed with tire plugs in 1.5mm and 3.5mm thickness. It weighs a claimed 24 grams and goes for $15.90 USD. The Suture Aero is the aforementioned combined with a CO2 inflator head. It weighs just 33 grams and retails at $26.99 USD. Both are available in black and orange. Fidlock are showing some nice stainless steel bottles; the above example has a piggyback friendly design, and could be a good option for small frames with tight clearance. They have much larger ones too. I think stainless steel is much nicer to drink out of than plastic bottles. You can get insulated and non-insulated versions. Switch Components, based out of Italy, were showing some of their biggest sellers. The Flat Carbon for XC weighs a claimed 135 grams and goes for 156 EUR."

        "content": "Race Report: NZ MTB Rally - Days 1 & 2: Words: NZ Mtb Rally The highly anticipated NZ MTB Rally 2025 has officially begun, delivering an unforgettable adventure through the breathtaking landscapes of the Nelson region, not to be confused with (Nelson, BC, Canada). The first two of six day of racing showcased challenging terrain and stunning scenery, reaffirming the event’s reputation as one of the premier multi-day Enduro-adventure races in the world. 120 Riders from around the world convened at Nelson, New Zealand, this weekend for the second edition of the NZ MTB Rally. We're pleased to see that more than 10 people (so 8%!) joined the first edition and came back for more! Excitement was high, with a promising weather forecast and a bucket list itinerary lined up for this week-long Enduro. For the majority of racers, this would be their first visit to the Nelson region, located at the Top of New Zealand's South Island. Whilst Nelson's reputation for long, raw, natural tracks is legendary in NZ racing circles, Nelson has remained very much under the radar to international audiences compared to the likes of Queenstown and Rotorua. The NZ MTB Rally promises to change that with a week-long, best-of-the-best, wild-ride travelling itinerary. A fresh McCashins (ginger) Beer, new friends from all over the world, and the perspective of an amazing week ahead of you... That's the feeling of Day 0 at the NZ MTB RALLY ! The Rally’s circular itinerary comprises an original route conceived especially for the race; sandwiched between 3 National Parks, taking in a blend of both historic backcountry tracks and purpose built MTB trails. But if you're thinking machine-build bike park, you'll be in for a surprise. The trails in Nelson and the surrounding area consist almost entirely of hand-built singletrack built by an enthusiastic local MTB community comprising over 3000 active members. In simple terms, the NZ MTB Rally is an uplift-assisted enduro race. With 4 to 6 gravity-biased race stages per day, connected by scenic backcountry liaisons and shuttled uplifts using 4×4, helicopter and boat. Visiting a notably different ride-spot each day from three different basecamp locations. It’s a route that gives the impression of going on a coherent journey with a purpose rather than simply cruising from one bike park to the next on a coach tour. A BILLIONAIRE'S PRIVATE BIKE PARK 7 stages // 28km // -2800m // +660m 4X4 SHUTTLES // ALL. DAY. LONG. With so much great riding on offer across the Top- of-the-South Island in NZ, there was no time to ease them in gently, so first up was a 30-minute shuttle from camp down a narrow gravel track deep into The Wairoa Gorge. This deep, rugged valley was purchased back in the ’90s by a secretive billionaire in order to create his own rider’s Disneyland for his exclusive, private, personal use. It was hand-built over several years by a trail crew picked out from amongst the world’s best. Sam Blenkinsop, fastest rider on Day 1 Destiny would have it that the entire site was recently gifted to NZ’s Department of Conservation, who in turn handed it over to Nelson MTB Club for operational management. (Sweet as, billionaire bro!) This is no fairy-tale, just 72 km of exquisitely crafted beech-forested goodness, accessed all day long by a fleet of 4x4 shuttles and privatized for Day one of the NZ MTB Rally. Game on! 8 Stages of beech-forest goodness were on the menu, split over three long uplifts up the park’s steep central shuttle road. A 4x4 fleet of various shapes and sizes, including Mitsubishi Tritons, a fleet of Troop-Carriers, and specially adapted, jacked-up 4x4 ski-field busses were needed to shuttle up all these riders on this rough terrain! Anyone here thinking 2800m of descent in a day is no big deal would best be advised to reserve comment until the end of the day. These are 100% hand-built tracks, and while they are amazingly flowy and rewarding if you work hard, they will physically punish you if you don’t. Either way, don’t expect more than the briefest of moments of off-the-brakes cruising at any point whilst on stage today! An impressive suspension bridge spanned the clear waters of the river, bringing racers directly out to the finish paddock area. Those who had already finished their day were more than happy to line up at the finish and watch the spectacle of their competitors tackling this trail, descending from on high across the valley. The subsequent heckling was inevitable...and encouraged by the organizers, who even provided vuvuzelas and air-horns to anyone who wanted to get rowdy about it. The atmosphere at the finish line was electric as riders swapped stories about their best runs and near-misses over a traditional Kiwi sausage sizzle by the iconic suspension bridge. With cold beers and ciders, one ice from local award-winning brewer McCashins in hand, the day ended with laughter, high-fives, and the excitement of what lay ahead. From left to right: Sam Blenkinsop takes the win on this first day, with a total of 45mn48sc, Kilian Bron is only 4sc behind him and Matt Walker 11sc! Tuhoto Ariki, the NZ DH Champion, is 4th, and these tight gaps promise an amazing fight for the win during the week! Vivine GUNTENSPERGER, from Swiss, is leading in the women category! Matt Fairbrother Injured Sadly, Matt Fairbrother, the heroic winner of the first edition, had an unfortunate crash on stage 2 and injured his shoulder. He will be okay but won't be able to keep racing this week. Get well soon, Matt! Time to go back to base camp to charge the batteries and get ready for Day 2! Flow, Views, and Good Vibes - 5 Stages // -2450m // +690m Day two brought a total change of scenery as The Rally moved toward a totally new destination, one not used in the first edition: Silvan Forest and the open ridgelines of Richmond Hills, combining lush singletrack with expansive coastal views. Silvan Forest Mountain Bike Park is a privately owned 180-hectare forest with Matt, the landowner, a keen mountain biker (and actually racing NZ MTB Rally this year - talk about home trails advantage!). Established through a collaboration between the Griffin family and the MTB Trails Trust, the park features well-graded single-track climbing paths and exhilarating downhill runs suitable for various skill levels. Riders can enjoy stunning scenic views of the surrounding landscape. Today's course tags together three separate trail areas by including Jenkins Hill and Kingsland Forest, with four big shuttles and stunning transitions across the tops of the Richmond Ranges between stages. The Richmond Hills introduced a different flavour of wide-open ridgelines with fast, loose descents that rewarded big speed and confidence Silvan Forest delivered a mix of tight, twisting singletrack and fast, sculpted berms, winding through towering pine trees and dense native bush. The grip was incredible, allowing riders to push their limits and truly let the bike dance through the turns. Beyond the riding, the atmosphere was unbeatable. Cheering spectators, stunning panoramic ocean views, and a relaxed post-race vibe made the day feel more like an epic group ride than a competition. The day finished at the jaw-dropping Silvan Steps, an outdoor amphitheatre that usually hosts music concerts. Today, it was beers and a BBQ where we enjoyed fresh game caught by the local hunters in the surrounding area. This is what the NZ MTB RALLY is all about! The kind of day that puts a big smile on your face for a long time Dusty day, happy day! The top three gather at the finish line, comparing times… We're up against real pro riders with incredible consistency! The rankings and tight gaps are almost identical to day one. Sam Blenkinsop holds onto the lead with an additional 4 seconds ahead of Kilian Bron, who Sam Walker closely follows. But there's still a long week ahead! Tuhoto Ariki, currently in 4th place, is still very much in the game. Vivine GUNTENSPERGER is leading the female category with 1:37:17sc of total time racing in two days. With two days down and four to go, the NZ MTB Rally is proving once again why it’s one of the most unique and exhilarating MTB stage races in the world. The mix of technical riding, wild landscapes, and an incredible community spirit creates an experience that goes far beyond racing—it’s about exploring, connecting, and making lifelong memories on the bike. Up next? The rally heads toward Golden Bay, where more iconic trails, epic backcountry adventures, and unforgettable moments await.

After yesterday's training day with heavy rain, which was more reminiscent of the end of the world, the weather managers organized it much better today, and so at least the conditions were dry from above. The track was still wet, of course, but at least it was no longer a river. Training in the Rain Despite, or perhaps because of, the difficult conditions, some of the riders made good use of yesterday's training time and reeled off their laps. Others withdrew early and waited for today. Saturday's Seeding Saturday started dry and, therefore, allowed for completely different speeds. The atmosphere was much more pleasant than the day before.

        "content": "XCC Short Track Race Analysis from the 2025 Araxá XC World Cup #1: The 2025 World Cup race season is officially underway after the U23 and elite XC racers took on the flat-out challenge of the XCC Short Track format in Brazil. After 20 minutes of furious bar-to-bar racing, we have our first World Cup winners of 2025, with Isabella Holmgren, Sondre Rokke, Evie Richards and Christopher Blevins taking the top honours at round one. Check out some quick race stats and a full breakdown of the elite races below. Quick Race Stats U23 Women's Winning Margin: Isabella Holmgren - 4 Seconds U23 Men's Winning Margin: Sondre Rokke - 1 Second Elite Women's Winning Margin: Evie Richards - 1 Second Elite Men's Winning Margin: Christopher Blevins - 1 Second U23 Women's Winner's Average Speed: Isabella Holmgren - 26.36km/h // 16.38mph U23 Men's Winner's Average Speed: Sondre Rokke - 30.22km/h // 18.78mph Elite Women's Winner's Average Speed: Evie Richards - 27.26km/h // 16.94mph Elite Men's Winner's Average Speed: Christopher Blevins - 30.79km/h // 19.13mph U23 Women's Fastest Lap: Carla Hahn - 3:01.3 ( Lap 3 ) U23 Men's Fastest Lap: Brayden Johnson: 2:34.8 ( Lap 7 ) Elite Women's Fastest Lap: Evie Richards: 2:52.9 ( Lap 7 ) Elite Men's Fastest Lap: Victor Koretzky: 2:27.2 ( Lap 8 ) U23 Women's Top 5/10 % Spread: 0.53% / 4.48% U23 Men's Top 5/10 % Spread: 0.26% / 0.6% Elite Women's Top 5/10 % Spread: 1.71% / 2.18% Elite Men's Top 5/10 % Spread: 0.54% / 1% Elite Women's Race Breakdown Evie Richards rode an incredible race taking the opening round victory in the XCC Short Track Rainbow Stripes. After maintaining a position in the lead group throughout the seven laps, Richards only moved to the front in a big attack on the final climb allowing her to build a lead in the jump section before the sprint to the line. Samara Maxwell started her year with a second-place finish, ending the race with a one-second gap from Richards. Despite recovering from ACL surgery, Alessandra Keller showed her usual formidable XCC speed as she challenged for the lead through the race, taking third place at the finish line. Elite Women's Top 5: 1st. Evie Richards: 21:25 2nd. Samara Maxwell: 21:26 // +1 3rd. Alessandra Keller: 21:30 // +5 4th. Nicole Koller: 21:37 // +12 5th. Sina Frei: 21:47 // +22 Story of the Race Top 10 Fastest Laps In her race-winning ride on the final lap, Evie Richards set the best lap time of the race, beating second-placed Samara Maxwell's seventh lap by 1.2 seconds. Setting almost identical times, Nicole Koller and Alessandra Keller set the third and fourth fastest lap times. Interestingly, the next three times came from the first lap, with Jenny Rissveds going 5.5 seconds slower than the top time of Richards' final lap. The only top 10 lap time not from either the first or last lap was Jennifer Jackson's third lap. Lap Time Difference Comparing every lap time across all laps in the elite women's race, the final loop created the largest gaps outside the top five times. The fourth lap did have a bigger gap between the top times, with a 3.89% difference between the fastest and second-fastest laps. The second lap produced some of the closest racing, with the fifth lap not far behind. The first lap had some of the closest times across the five fastest rider times, but outside the top 15 laps, it had the second-largest time gaps. Elite Men's Race Breakdown Christopher Blevins delivered a masterclass in XCC racing, taking a dramatic win to open the 2025 World Cup series. In a close battle against his Specialized teammate, it was an all-out drag race to the finish line, with Blevins pulling ahead of XCC World Champion Victor Koretzky by one second. Despite a big mistake on lap seven that caused Koretzky to drop back to tenth, he fought back from disaster to almost take the win in Brazil. Securing a podium for the new Origine Racing Division, Mathis Azzaro made it two French riders inside the top three. Azzaro was also the only racer to go with the final attack from the Specialized teammates. Elite Men's Top 5: 1st. Christopher Blevins: 21:40 2nd. Victor Koretzky: 21:41 // +1 3rd. Mathis Azzaro: 21:42 // +2 4th. Thomas Litscher: 21:46 // +6 5th. Jordan Sarrou: 21:47 // +7 Story of the Race Top 10 Fastest Laps After a big mistake on the penultimate lap, a charging Victor Koretzky may have just missed out on the win, but he still secured the top lap time. In his efforts to fight back from tenth place after his lap-seven mistake, Koretzky went 4.1 seconds faster than race-winner Christopher Blevins on lap eight. Unlike the elite women's race, where we saw three different laps represented across the top ten, for the men, the only rider who made it inside the top ten with a time not from the final lap was Jordan Sarrou. The French racer had a great seventh lap, falling only 6.8 seconds off Koretzky's final lap time. Lap Time Difference For the elite men, the final lap, where we saw Victor Koretzky fight back to the front and a brutal attack by Christopher Blevins, created the largest gaps between riders, with a difference of 3.4% for the top five times. The next biggest gap between the top five lap times was 2.61% on lap seven. On lap five, where we saw the race close up, there was just a 0.61% gap between the five fastest times.

        "content": "Ari Bikes Announces Timp Peak 2.0 Long Travel eMTB: PRESS RELEASE: Ari Bikes Ari Bikes is excited to introduce the Timp Peak 2.0, the second generation of its premier electric enduro bike. The all-new Timp Peak is a slab-stomping, enduro-smashing, long travel electric mountain bike built for riders who crave huge climbs and steep, chunky descents. Timp Peak is powered by the Bosch Performance Line CX Gen 5 drive unit and a rider’s choice of the PowerTube 800 Wh or 600 Wh battery, with compatibility for the PowerMore 250 Wh range extender across all sizes. Four-way adjustable geometry flip chips offer 29er and mullet compatibility while sleek component integration and dialed builds offer the performance and refinement riders expect. Ride hard, charge, repeat. Timp Peak is ready. Timp Peak 2.0 Details • Wheel size: 29'' or mullet (customer's choice) • Travel: 170mm rear, 170mm fork • Carbon frame • 63.6°- 64.4° head angle • 78° seat tube angle • Chainstay length: 437mm-443mm • Bosch Performance Line CX Gen 5 drive unit • 800 Wh or 600 Wh PowerTube battery (customer’s choice) • PowerMore 250 Wh range extender compatible (all sizes) • Lifetime warranty to original owner (transferable warranty to second owner) • Sizes: S, M, L, XL • Weight: 49.8lbs/22.6kg (size large, mullet, PowerTube 600, tubeless, DoubleDown/DH tires front and rear, respectively) • Price: $5,799 - $8,999 USD • More info: aribikes.com/timp-peak Who’s it for: Big days, bigger smiles. With a helping hand up the hill and incredible stability at speed when descending, Timp Peak helps riders see new lines, cover more ground, or lap their favorite trail again and again. Timp Peak is made for massive backcountry rides, e-enduro stage races, and ripping local trails with friends. For riders seeking electrified smiles on two wheels, Timp Peak delivers a dynamic dose of fun on every ride. Key Features of Timp Peak 2.0: Bosch Drive System Timp Peak is powered by the Bosch Performance Line CX Gen 5 drive unit. A new through-bolt mounting system and updated internals deliver high-torque, controllable power on the trail (85 Nm of torque and 600 W peak output). The Bosch wireless Mini Remote, top tube integrated System Controller, and Flow app customization provide a refined on-trail experience that allows riders to dial in their Timp Peak and see system information at a glance. Bosch Performance Line CX Gen 5 Drive Unit • 85 Nm torque • 600 W peak output • No chainring clutch rattle • Reduced motor noise Two Battery Sizes + Range Extender Range, more range, or all the range. Timp Peak is compatible with Bosch’s 800 Wh or 600 Wh PowerTube batteries. (Riders can choose their preferred battery size at checkout.) Additionally, all frame sizes are compatible with the Bosch PowerMore 250 Wh range extender, and the main internal battery can be swapped out without dropping the drive unit. In Ari's testing, a 6’4’’ 240 lbs rider was able to achieve 8,100 vertical feet of climbing in the Turbo mode when pairing the 800 Wh battery with the 250 Wh range extender. Tetra-Link Suspension Platform Revised kinematics for increased downhill performance. Timp Peak delivers 170mm of rear wheel travel via the Tetra-Link suspension platform. Its adjusted kinematics provide a more consistent and lower overall anti-rise (hovers near 40% throughout the full travel range) when compared to the Timp Peak 1.0. The goal of the reduced anti-rise is to keep Timp Peak more active while braking to maintain traction and have supple suspension on tap when hitting bumps with the brakes applied. A near 100% anti-squat at sag pays dividends on the climbs helping preserve geometry when putting the power down and keeping the chassis stable as riders rack up vertical feet. Timp Peak 2.0 has a slightly more progressive leverage ratio than the outgoing model that is optimize for modern large volume air shocks like the RockShox Vivid and Fox Float X2 that behave in a more linear, coil-like fashion. Timp Peak also works well with coil shocks. Adaptable Enduro Geometry Timp Peak 2.0 geometry (short chainstay, low bottom bracket, 29'' rear wheel). Four-way adjustable flip chips in the suspension linkage provide geometry and wheel size adjustments to hone the Timp Peak’s handling for various types of trails. Riders can adjust chainstay length, bottom bracket height, and headtube angle via these flip chips or use them to set up Timp Peak for a 27.5'' rear wheel. Headtube angles range from 63.6°- 64.4° (stock setting is 64°) and chainstay lengths can be adjusted between 437mm - 443mm. A 78° effective seat tube angle at real world saddle heights puts riders in a powerful pedaling position, while short crank arms reduce pedal strikes when hammering through rocky terrain. Stack height has increased by 7mm - 12mm per size compared to the outgoing model giving riders more confidence and control when descending. An interactive geometry and wheel size configurer is available on Ari's website to see all available configurations. prev 2/5 next Timp Peak's adjustable geometry allows riders to dial in their preferred handling and wheel size. System Optimized Packaging An inside look at the Timp Peak (size small). Timp Peak packs everything riders expect of a modern enduro bike into a sleek package without letting the ‘e-bike’ get in the way. The new vertical shock orientation and precise placement of the Bosch drive system result in lower standover height, long dropper post insertion depth, and the ability to swap the internal battery without removing the drive unit all while keeping the mass low and centered in the frame. Timp Peak’s standard eyelet, non-trunnion shock reduces wear and tear on the suspension internals and lowers friction when compared to side-load binding’s effect on trunnion shocks. Ride in Pure Silence Locked in. Every detail of Timp Peak is designed to eliminate distractions. Tube-in-tube cable routing silences rattles while custom-molded protectors keep chain slap quiet. The new Bosch Performance Line CX Gen 5 drive unit is quieter than ever and has eliminated chainring clutch rattle when descending. The only sound riders will hear is tires on dirt—and maybe their own whoop of stoke. Prepared For Every Ride Water bottle and accessory mounts. Timp Peak has room for at least a 21 oz water bottle inside the front triangle of every size and an accessory mount for a bolt-on tool kit or gear dock under the top tube. Riders can carry water, tools, or nutrition via these mounting points so they always have what they need on their ride.

        "content": "Review: Michelin Wild AM2 & Force AM2 Tires: Front and rear wheels have different jobs on the bike. In turn, we see tire manufacturers making specific treads for those purposes. While that's a good play for some conditions, we've seen plenty of riders disregard that logic and go their own route. In Michelin’s case, they have the Wild AM2 and Force AM2, which slot into the all-mountain category.  The Wild is designed for soft conditions while the Force is best for hard-packed trails. Neither are front or rear specific, per se, however, they can make for a versatile pairing. Wild AM2 and Force AM2 Details • Mixed condition treads • 2.4 and 2.6\" widths • 27.5\" and 29\" diameters • Gravity Shield casing • Gum-X compound • Wild AM2 29x2.4\" weight: 1,022 g • Force AM2 29x2.4\" weight: 1,022 g • Price: $64.99 USD / $87.99 CAD • michelinman.com Both have a focus on covering mixed terrain and offer durability at a reasonable weight of around 1,030 g (29 x 2.4\"). They also come in an attractive price, but there are some peculiarities that point them to more specific conditions than what the marketing copy states. Wild AM2 Force AM2 Specifications Both the Wild AM2 and Force AM2 use the same rubber formula and casing construction. These all-mountain tires use a layering they call Gravity Shield, despite Michelin also offering their more appropriately named Trail Shield in other models. They’re built with a 3x60 TPI (threads per inch) casing and foldable bead. The sidewalls align with Maxxis’ EXO+ casing in terms of use case, but have a stiffer flex characteristic. Michelin has also selected their single-compound Gum-X rubber formula, which prioritizes rolling efficiency over grip. That comes with a particular flavor on the trail but isn’t too far behind Maxxis 3C Maxx Terra rubber. For stickier, more robust options with similar tread intentions, look to the Wild Enduro MH and Wild Enduro Rear tires. Price and Weight The Michelin Wild AM2 clocks in at 1,022 grams - a respectable weight given its toughness. That puts it close to a 29x2.4” Maxxis DHRII EXO 3C Maxx Terra (1008 g). The volume appears on the smaller side and the claimed 2.4” width actually measures out to be 2.32” or 59mm. With a slightly lower profile tread, the Force AM2 is surprisingly a shade heavier at 1,032 grams. My calipers measure the claimed width to be bang on 61mm (2.4”) across the widest part of the tread. For those looking for a larger footprint and caring less about weight, a larger 2.6” options exist in both treads. Both of these AM2 tires come in at a very respectable price of $64.99 USD. That’s substantially less than a Maxxis EXO+ 3C tire ($93 USD) or a Schwalbe Trail Evo variant ($95). We’ll talk more about the performance and durability, but they are of great value, depending on the climate you ride in. Installation and Setup Fitting these AM2 tires onto the rim is easy enough without levers due to the 61 - 622 ETRTO specification (622 mm being the inside tire diameter). That did cause a headache on a set of Race Face Era wheels (30mm internal rim width) which had no trouble taking various other brands of tires. I tried all the tricks between pressurized pumps and removing valve cores with no success. Throughout the testing period, I went back and forth between Reserve 30HD and Zipp 3Zero Moto wheels. The AM2 tires seated on those wheels without issue. The Wild AM2s arrived further back in time where they served as both front and rear tires. When the Force AM2 showed up, that remained as a rear tire (with the exclusion of one ride up front) due to the wet winter conditions lingering around Squamish. In terms of pressures, I generally stuck with 20-23 psi up front and 24-27 out back, regardless of the tire. Shorter travel bikes saw the lower end of pressures while experimentation with the AM2 tires on an E-bike saw a higher range. As expected, higher pressures were used in drier, faster conditions, like the Chilocotin region of B.C., whereas sliding around Squamish called for lower pressures. Performance Traction: Leaning it over, the Wild AM2 has a semi-predictable amount of traction. I’d slot it in between two popular Maxxis tires; the Minion DHF and Minion DHRII. Whether it comes down to the rubber compound or the minimal siping, the Wild AM2 doesn’t conform to packed dirt quite as well as the DHRII and can slide sooner. The lean-in is more predictable than the DHF though. Conversely, the Wild AM2 digs in with more bite than either of those Maxxis options in soft conditions, almost like a mini-spike. On the brakes, the Wild AM2 shuts down very quickly in a straight line in soft conditions. Those conditions tend to be wet and hide roots and rocks though, which is where the rubber detracts slightly from the tire's moment of glory. The Force spent most of its time on the rear wheel, where it handled hard-packed dirt in a predictable fashion. Larger shoulder knobs come in handy for soft conditions, making it a versatile option. It can clog up and slide when braking in a straight line on duffy trails as expected, but at least it's consistent, especially when transferring onto the shoulder knobs. Uphills with exposed roots or slick rock faces aren't where this Force shines. It's intended for hard-packed, yet mixed conditions, so I'd still expect the tighter spaced center knobs to handle slick rock, wet or dry, reasonably well. That's not exactly the case though. The Gum-X grip is a similar to Maxxis’s 3C Maxx Terra compound. It's tacky to the touch, but firm as well - similar to Five Ten's Stealth Rubber shoe soles. It works best in drier conditions and at speed, where it the denser rubber offers a muted ride quality. It leaves me thinking, how would a Gum-2XD (or 3XD) version of the Wild and Force AM2s would perform in those scenarios? I'm sure every tire manufacturer has heard this tale before though - the consumers wants an option that isn't offered. On dry slick rock, the rubber can stick, but can start sliding with any sign of moisture. Support: Part of that conforming issue could come down to the rubber, but also the casing. The Gravity Shield casing wasn't the most supple on small roots until the pressures were lowered 20 psi up front and 24 out back. On the plus side, the Gravity Shield casing was highly resilient to pinch flats and slashes for a 1,032 g tire, at least in my experience. It tended to hold strong in corners and compressions experienced within the bounds of most blue and black trails around Squamish. E-bikers will likely want to step up to the heavier, and possibly larger volume tires in Michelins range though as they require higher pressures to retain some stability. Bumping up the pressure will come with the trade off of losing grip. Durability: Security seems to run strong in the Michelin family of tires and that holds true for the Wild AM2 and Force AM2. Neither tire burped air, even when venturing down to the low 20 psi range. Zero flats occurred through the test period either. Plenty of rocks were hit and a few hucks brought the rim down savagely into the tire casing, but they have shaken off everything I could throw at them. The Wild has seen its fair share of abusive dry, rocky conditions that can usually chew and chunk tires rapidly, but the tread barely shows any signs of breaking down. As mentioned, the Force has seen less time strapped to a bike, and its regularly been used in the wetter months, but I’d expect the tread to hold up equally as well. Rolling Speed: The benefit of the Gum-X rubber, which prioritizes rolling efficiency, is more apparent on the Force than the Wild. The taller center knobs of the Wild can be overbearing on machine made trails. They tend to clunk along versus the smoother Force. As a combo, the Wild (front) and Force (rear) are can work for variable conditions but expect less braking traction with the Force on the rear wheel for that increase in rolling speed. Wild AM2 Pros + Strong cornering and braking traction in soft conditions. + Durable casing and long-lasting rubber. + Attractive price tag. Cons - Rubber compound glances off rocks and roots more than expected for a mixed terrain tire. - Measured smaller than advertised. Force AM2 Pros + Predictable cornering traction on a variety of surfaces. + Durable casing and long-lasting rubber. + Attractive price tag. Cons - Rubber compound has limitations on wet rock and root."

        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-polygon-collosus-n9.html",
        "content": "First Ride: Polygon's $3,199 Collosus N9: There have been plenty of high-end bikes on the site recently, but Polygon's latest enduro bike brings us back down to earth. With a starting price of $2,299 for the N7 model, rising to $3,199 for the N9 spec tested, it represents impressive value for money. That latter price gets you high-end Fox suspension and Shimano XT brakes and gears - products often seen on bikes costing twice as much. The frame is interesting too, with Polygon's complicated Independent Floating Suspension system and a new dropout to swap between 29\" and 27.5\" rear wheels with UDH compatability. The catch? The Collosus is not for weight weenies, at 18 kg in XL. Collosus N9 Details • Wheel size: 29\" or MX • Travel: 170 mm f&r • Aluminum frame • 63.5º head angle • 77º seat tube angle • 435 mm chainstays • Sizes: S - XL • Weight: 39.7 lb / 18.0 kg (size XL) • Price: $2,299 to $3,199 USD • polygonbikes.com Frame Details The main update to the Collosus is the swinging dropout which compensates for the difference in wheel size to maintain similar geometry numbers with a 27.5\" or 29\" rear wheel by switching a flip chip. The new dropout is compatible with SRAM Transmission drivetrains and uses the widely available UDH standard. The frame has space for a water bottle and bosses for tools or other accessories under the top tube. Polygon say they've stiffened up the frame compared to its predecessor and it's got some decent frame protection on the chainstay and downtube, although the chainstay protector could be longer. Cable routing is internal and neat, although the rear brake hose runs external to the chainstay. Although there are no internal cable guides inside the downtube, the cables don't rattle noticeably. Geometry Polygon's press release states the chainstay length has been increased from 435 mm to 445 mm, but the geometry table above puts it at 435 mm. I used a tape measure to clear the confusion: it measures 435 mm in the 29\" setting. One figure that stands out to me is that the stack height is on the shorter side, especially in the XL size, thanks to relatively stubby head tubes. Suspension Design Polygon's unique-looking IFS suspension layout may look like a six-bar, but it's technically a four-bar design. A pair of short counter-rotating links above the bottom bracket define the motion of the chainstay/swingarm, onto which the axle and brake are connected. The pedalling and braking behaviour is dictated entirely by these four members: the two short links plus the swingarm and mainframe. The seatstay and rocker link are just there to drive the shock (as well as add rigidity) and this determines the leverage the wheel has over the shock, and therefore how progressive the suspension is. The idea is that Polygon can adjust pivot placements to fine-tune the leverage curve independently of the pedalling and braking behaviour. Polygon say the anti-squat sits at around 120% at sag, which helps it stay high in its travel while pedalling. Specs The N9 has some standout spec highlights for the price, including the Fox Float X2 Performance Elite shock, a Fox 38 fork with the underrated Grip damper, and Shimano XT brakes and drivetrain (albeit with an SLX cassette). It's also nice to see a proper chainguide with bash protection and 165 mm cranks for pedal clearance. Shortcomings to bear in mind are the single-compound and EXO-casing Maxxis Assegai tires, which are fragile for a bike like this. Also, the TransX dropper post is a little short on travel and overall length in the case of the XL size. At 6'3\" / 190 cm, I'm at the lower end of the height range for an XL size yet I couldn't quite get the saddle high enough at the seatpost's maximum extension. Side note: with shorter cranks, you need your saddle higher for optimal leg extension. There is an even more affordable Collosus N7 for $900 less than the N9. Spec comparison below: Ride Impressions While the Polygon's 18 kg bulk isn't negligible compared to high-end carbon enduro bikes, it's a surprisingly capable climber. The 77-degree effective seat angle (measured) keeps you in a nice position over the bottom bracket for steep climbs and the suspension does a good job of staying on top of its travel and feeling supportive when putting down power, especially in the climbing gears. There is a little bob towards the middle of the cassette and I think the seat tube could be steeper still, but considering this bike's price and intended use, it holds its own uphill. When it was time to descend I had to drop the seatpost manually because the dropper's travel wasn't sufficient to get the saddle fully out of the way. I also found the XL's cockpit on the low side. Even with 25 mm of spacers under the stem, the low front-end and relatively long 50 mm stem create an over-the-front sensation on steeper sections and the handlebar feels like it's falling away from you when riding over crests and drops. I'd budget for a higher handlebar and a longer dropper if you're a tall rider. Ironically, one of the most high-end components was the least impressive - the XT brakes on my test bike had an inconsistent bite-point even after a bleed and piston adjustment. That aside, the Collosus is impressive for the price. The Fox 38 Grip fork is supple and comfortable over high-frequency bumps. It lacks support and fine-tuning compared to its pricier stablemates, but you can meaningfully hold the fork up by turning the compression dial a few clicks clockwise. The four-way adjustable shock has plenty of scope for fettling, but even with the stock volume spacers the suspension feels relatively supportive towards the end of the stroke without any abrupt ramp. It's a forgiving feel that throws up few surprises or quirks to work around. The 435 mm chainstay length is on the shorter side, which makes it easy to get the front wheel aloft. But thanks to the low front end I felt more over the front than off the back when the terrain got hectic."

        "author": "Dario DiGiulio",
        "date": "04-07-2025",
        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-the-odyssey-optis-is-a-tunable-tire-insert.html",
        "content": "First Ride: The Odyssey Optis is a Tunable Tire Insert: The popularity of tire inserts have waxed and waned over the years, with all manners of foam stuffed into rubber to improve the rider experience. Some have stuck to the program out of sheer ride-saving necessity, while others seek out the performance gains they can yield. The Odyssey Optis aims to accomplish both goals, while remaining low in weight and allowing for some tuning of the ride feel. The Optis may look like a tube, but the resemblance ends at first glance - and there's more than meets the eye. Optis Details • Tunable air chamber insert • Acts as a bead lock • Prevents rim damage • 27.5\" or 29\" options • Weight: 98-103g • Price: $90 USD • odysseymtb.com Features The Optis is cleverly simple, utilizing a TPU impregnated nylon fabric for the tubular insert, and a two-stage aluminum valve to control the two air pressures. The insert is replaceable, and the valve system can be carried through to other inserts if need be. The insert's fabric is waterproof, so there's no risk of sealant absorption over use. This means the Optis should stay the same weight as when you installed it, without changing your tubeless system's ability to plug a hole should one occur. You'll be able to tune tire pressure and Optis pressure trail-side, as the paired valves stay installed as long as you continue to run the insert. The Optis pressure isn't unusually high, so you'll be able to easily change things with a typical hand pump. Odyssey's recommended setups. As you'd expect, the Optis is available in 27.5\" and 29\" versions, weighing 98g and 103g on my scale, with all the valve spacers and caps included. The Optis aims to prevent tire burping at low pressures by locking the beads in place, to prevent pinch flats with the secondary air chamber it offers, to support the tire in hard compressions, and to act as a temporary run-flat if you lose all pressure in the main tire chamber. Comparisons The obvious comparison here is going to be Schwalbe's Procore system, as the first and foremost tube-like insert on the market. In fact, the Procore really is just a tube, albeit with a hard liner that sheathes it as well. Procore's insert pressures range from 60-80psi, and are primarily targeting pinch flats and tire burping - Optis tackles those but also hopes to add some compliance to the mix. There are plenty of foam inserts out there, but the concept behind something like the Optis is different enough to stand apart - assuming the tunable element is something you're after. If simplicity is the goal, I'd still go with a foam option, as there are some complexities and potential failure points with the Optis. Installation Installing the Optis can be quite easy, as my first few installations only added a couple minutes to the process. Odyssey has a thorough set of instructions that come with the inserts, and I'd stick to those to keep things smooth. Like a standard tube, adding a bit of air before installing can ease the process a bit, and keep the tire from trapping the fabric along the bead. Once you have the tire seated, it's just a matter of setting the air pressures as recommended by Odyssey. There's one confusing element here, and that's how the two pressures influence each other. Playing around with Optis and tire pressure, I've noticed that the tire's pressure does have some impact on how much pressure is reading in the Optis, as it's functionally the atmosphere around the insert. Repeatable steps will be the name of the game here, just to make sure that you're getting consistent readings for your setup. Unfortunately, not every install was a painless process, as my last attempt ended in failure due to a small weak point in the Optis system. The gold Optis valve uses a small plastic straw to feed air into the tubular insert, with a small bit remaining exposed during installation and removal. While removing the Optis from a tire, I must have caused that straw to fold over on itself, as it became crimped and no longer consistently feeds air into the Optis. Because this straw has to push through a rubber orifice on the tube, some structural integrity is key to it working. I tried rounding it out with some needlenose pliers, but to no avail. I'm not sure how I would have avoided this, as the removal wasn't a struggle and required no unusual force. Hopefully this is a fluke, but we'll see how future installations go. As for replacing that small element, I've reached out to Odyssey to inquire about spares - hopefully that's an easy swap. Update: I've heard back from Odyssey, and it sounds like this is a known issue with the first batch of Optis inserts. \"The straw length on the first production batch can be variable in length at times, allowing a kink to happen in some cases during assembly. We’ve already set up the tooling needed to have strict control over the length on future batches. It is also important to be sure that the straw is fully seated in the insert's valve port prior to assembly.\" Ride Impressions My time on the Optis is fairly limited so far, but I've run the setup with both Specialized Grid Gravity and Maxxis DoubleDown tires to see how different casings can play with the variety of pressure options. As with most inserts, you can comfortably run a few less psi per tire without concern of rolling or burping the carcass, and I found the minor weight penalty of the Optis to be negligible. With the Grid Gravity rubber, I can typically run 21/23psi front/rear, and with the Optis I was able to drop that down to 18/20psi. As you'd expect, the tire deforms more over obstacles, has more ground contact, and feels a bit mushier in supported turns - without causing any issues with air loss, luckily. Real testing with the system will have to come once bike park season is here, as repeat laps with different inserts, pressures, and tire combinations is the only consistent means towards getting a good feel for the differences. The Odyssey Optis will be retailing for $89.99 per wheel, with replacement inserts available for $39.99. More information can be found at Odyssey's website ."

Kicking off the 2025 World Cup series, we saw two close races from the U23 racers, with Isabella Holmgren and Sondre Rokke securing their first wins of the season. Both racers will get the best grid position in tomorrow's XCO race. Evie Richards rode an incredible race taking the opening round victory in the XCC Short Track Rainbow Stripes. After maintaining a position in the lead group throughout the seven laps, Richards only moved to the front in a big attack on the final climb allowing her to build a lead in the jump section before the sprint to the line. Samara Maxwell started her year with a second-place finish, ending the race with a one-second gap from Richards. Despite recovering from ACL surgery, Alessandra Keller showed her usual formidable XCC speed as she challenged for the lead through the race, taking third place at the finish line. Christopher Blevins delivered a masterclass in XCC racing, taking a dramatic win to open the 2025 World Cup series. In a close battle against his Specialized teammate, it was an all-out drag race to the finish line, with Blevins pulling ahead of XCC World Champion Victor Koretzky by one second. Despite a big mistake on lap seven that caused Koretzky to drop back to tenth, he fought back from disaster to almost take the win in Brazil. Securing a podium for the new Origine Racing Division, Mathis Azzaro made it two French riders inside the top three. Azzaro was also the only racer to go with the final attack from the Specialized teammates. Check out the results below. Race Results Elite Women: 1st. Evie Richards: 21:25 2nd.

        "title": "First Ride: Rotwild R.EX Mid-Pivot eMTB",
        "author": "Jessie-May Morgan",
        "date": "04-07-2025",
        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-rotwild-rex-mid-pivot-emtb.html",
        "content": "First Ride: Rotwild R.EX Mid-Pivot eMTB: The Rotwild R.EX is one of two bikes in their lineup to utilize their Mid-High Pivot suspension platform. I will point out right away that this bike does not have the rearward arcing axle path we have come to associate with high-pivot suspension designs. As such, it also does not exhibit the considerable chain growth that would necessitate use of an idler pulley. It is however a relatively unusual execution of the four-bar linkage with elevated stays and an aggressive, modern geometry that looks very much fit for purpose. While the enduro race-oriented R.EXC is a highly adjustable affair that can adapt to run 29\", 27.5\", or an MX wheelset, the 150mm R.EX that we concern ourselves with here is dedicated to MX wheels across the S-XL size range. I spent an afternoon familiarizing myself with the bike, and have some first ride impressions to share. Rotwild R.EX Details • Carbon frame • Travel: 160mm F, 150mm R • MX only • 64° seat angle • 77.2° seat angle • Reach: 436, 461, 485, 510mm • Chainstay length: 436mm • Shimano EP801 • 820 Wh battery • Maximum system weight limit: 130 kg • Actual weight: 22 kg (48.5 lbs) - Ultra w/pedals, S • Price: €11.490 (Ultra) • 6 year frame warranty • 6 year battery warranty • 2 year motor warranty • rotwild.com The lineup is straightforward with just two models to choose from. I rode the €11.490 Ultra model; components of note include the Fox 36 Factory fork with the GRIP X damper, a Fox Float X Factory shock, Shimano Deore XT Di2 electronic drivetrain, XT 4-Piston brakes, the frame-integrated NGS2 dropper seat post from 8Pins, and Crankbrothers Synthesis Carbon wheels fitted with 2.5\" Schwalbe Albert Gravity Trail tires in Radial casing. Frame Details & Motor The R.EX is a full-powered carbon eMTB with an 820 Wh battery on all sizes. Claimed weight for the size large is 21.4 kg. Though I'm sure it's not too far off, I'd contest that given that the small I rode weighed in at 22 kg with pedals. Still, that's impressive for a bike with such a high capacity battery. There are plenty of comparable carbon e-bikes on the market with a lower capacity main battery that weigh more than this - like the Canyon Spectral:ON, and the YT Decoy MX. The bike has an impressive battery. It is of Rotwild's own design, housing Gen2 cells (type 21.700) inside a lightweight carbon housing. It has a very compact footprint given its 820 Wh capacity, and it weighs a claimed 3.66 kg. That's a density of 224 Wh/kg, versus the Bosch PowerTube 800 with a density of 205 Wh/kg. A brass locking pin secures it into the downtube; pushing that gold button near the head tube twice releases it for charging off the bike. It is very easy and convenient. The battery gets a two-year warranty, and a four-year manufacturer’s guarantee on top of that. Like the R.EXC, this 150mm affair runs the Shimano EP801 motor with a maximum torque of 85 Nm. The Deore XT Di2 derailleur is wired into the system. On-bike charging is also possible, though the charging port is poorly positioned on the underside of the downtube right in the firing line of crud and stones thrown up off the front tire. It is well-sealed to be fair but if you are riding in a wet climate this could be a point of concern. Only the wiring for the motor system runs into the headtube; the brake hose and dropper cable are routed into the frame aft of the headtube. The oversized spacers underneath the stem are split into two pieces each so you don't have to remove the stem and disconnect the wires in order to alter ride height. That said, you will need to carry a standard spacer if you want to drop the stem position mid-ride, as those oversized spacers can't go on top. The Shimano Deore XT Di2 drivetrain has manual mode and Free Shift mode wherein the derailleur automatically shifts gear to a preset cadence as your rolling speed varies throughout a ride Given the actual length of the stays, it wouldn't unreasonable to wonder about the stiffness of the rear end. Rotwild tell us that the 'elevated box design' with the symmetrical elevated chainstay adds considerable stiffness to the bike, enough to satisfy the demands of the Rotwild Schwalbe Gravity team members. The bridge of the one piece chainstay is almost as tall as the tallest section of the stay where it reaches the apex of its triangulated shape. It leaves good clearance for the 27.5\" x 2.5\" Albert Gravity with plenty of space for mud to pass through, too. The size small gets the 8Pins seat post in a generous drop length of 168mm, though that can be adjusted down to 153mm as needed. At my height I was able to make use of the full drop length. It is very easy to adjust the height of the post, and it does perform exactly as intended. However, I find the design a little clunky for a few reasons. Firstly, a large spherical nut replaces the standard front bolt of the saddle clamp, making it very fiddly to install the saddle and dial in the perfect tilt angle. Secondly, there is very little resistance provided as you compress the post, with no progression in the amount of force required. While its action is very smooth, dropping the post can feel like quite a violent affair when you hit the bottom. Finally, the locking mechanism at the head of the post seems a little vulnerable to the elements. Though both models of the R.EX come with this unique post you can swap it out for any standard 34.9mm post if it isn't to your taste. With that straight uninterrupted seat tube most riders should be able to take advantage of a generously long dropper post. Geometry The R.EX with its MX wheelset has a modern combination of head and seat tube angle at 64° and 77.2°, respectively. While the enduro-focused sibling boasts chainstay and travel adjustments, the R.EX is free of adjustments. The reach numbers of the Rotwild R.EX are a touch longer than those on the longer travel R.EXC model, at 436mm, 461mm, 485mm and 510mm. One might think it to be much longer from a cursory glance, but the effective rear-center length at top-out is a relatively short 436mm - the same across all four front triangle sizes. The BB drop is 25mm. Stack height doesn't increase much as we look up the size options (just 4-5mm), and I can see taller riders accommodating for that with a bar with a little more rise than the stock 20mm. Suspension The four-bar suspension platform on the R.EX has a very high starting leverage ratio (3.3), thanks in part to the forward bias positioning of the main pivot. The idea here was to give the bike a short effective rear-center length with a kinematic that allows the bike to be very supple through the early part of its travel. It is consistently progressive thereafter, finishing up at around 2.4. While the chainstay is just 436mm at top-out, it does grow slightly to That high average leverage means the rear axle has a lot of mechanical advantage over the shock, increasing the required spring rate. That's something that riders on the heavier end of the spectrum will want to pay attention to, but the Fox Float X shock has a maximum pressure of 300 PSI so most will be accommodated for. The bike has an unusual kinematic for a four-bar Horst-link affair. While most bikes see anti-squat start high and slowly decrease through the travel, on the R.EX is starts high (120% at sag) and only gets higher. In regard to pedaling, we're only really concerned with how the suspension behaves under pedal-induced acceleration around the sag point, and an anti-squat of 120% suggests the bike will have a tendency to extend, coming up out of its travel. The very high anti-squat in the smaller sprockets of the cassette has implications for pedal kickback, however. The increasing amount of chain growth that will occur deeper into the travel will increase the risk of pedal kickback events, but realistically it shouldn't be of any great concern. Pedal kickback occurs much less than some would lead you to believe, and here is why . We asked Rotwild to share their thoughts on the bike's anti-squat. They said, \"In regard to Anti-Squat design we have been focusing on uphill trail riding. We think, the R.EX – same as the big brother R.EXC – should be suitable for technical uphill riding, like we see on uphill stages in eMTB racing. We have been looking into anti-squat behavior quite deeply and found out that an anti-squat of 100% plus, gives a lot of tracking, by keeping the suspension active in the travel, even with big steps, when the suspension goes quite far into the travel\". The anti-rise rises steadily through the travel, though it remains under 100% throughout the majority of the stroke, indicating the suspension should remain sufficiently active under braking and continue to provide decent levels of traction. First Ride Impressions At 163 cm (5ft 4\") I rode the Rotwild R.EX in a size small. It weighs 22 kg (48.5 lbs) with pedals. The reach is 435mm, paired with a 50mm stem. The 405mm seat tube is home to a 168mm travel 8Pins seat post, the full drop length of which I was able to benefit from. The effective seat tube angle of the R.EX is 77.2°, though it is likely a little slacker than that given the rearward offset of the 8Pins seat post saddle clamp. Sliding the saddle forward on the rails rectifies that somewhat, and I was able to find a comfortable seated pedaling position that puts my hips in a commanding position over the bottom bracket. I foresee taller rides wanting to switch out that offset clamp for the neutral option, particularly if much of their elevation gain comes from winching up steep grades. I was only afforded an afternoon on the Rotwild R.EX, in some very wet, slippery conditions, so my first ride impressions are limited. The bike was set up with the bar cut to my preferred 740mm, with the fork pressure and damper settings at Fox's stock recommendations, with 30% sag in the rear shock and compression and rebound damping open. For my 57 kgs (125 lb), that was around 150 psi - that pressure is not too much of a surprise, given the bike's high starting leverage ratio. I rode up a fire road and a twisty, slippery singletrack climb with the Shimano Free Shift mode on. It behaves much as advertised, automatically shifting the chain up or down the cassette to a gear that better matches your rolling speed. It can sound quite clunky as the chainring is pulling chain through to allow for a shift, but I soon got used to it. It's a feature that those new to mountain biking might appreciate most, but I imagine that seasoned riders will prefer to leave it manual. The suspension feels very supple off the top. Thereafter, the bike seems to manage its 150mm of rear wheel travel quite conservatively without feeling harsh. The descending position was comfortable enough, though I've a feeling I might have felt a little more comfortable with a slightly shorter stem and a lower stack, as I felt my arms being tugged away from me occasionally if I mis-timed attempts to unweight the front wheel. Still, the bike seemed to carry its weight well and was very playful - more so than lighterweight e-bikes I've ridden recently. Of course, it is the sum of its parts, but I'd be tempted to credit at least some of that to the bike's short effective rear-center and MX wheelset, both of which are general preferences of mine. The bike isn't the quietest owing to the scooshing noise made by the fork's GRIP X damper as it rebounds from the travel, and the clacking from the clutch of the Shimano EP801 motor. A shame on both counts, as the frame design itself makes for a quiet bike. The elevated stays clear the chain and as such chain slap is a non-issue. The Rotwild R.EX is a little on the pricier end of the spectrum as compared to some of its competitors but it remains an interesting proposition. The forward bias of the main pivot gives the bike an uncommonly high leverage rate for something with such a short effective rear-center length, and in the context of its 820 Wh removable battery, it isn't so portly for a full-powered e-bike. While it is not without its quirks there is certainly a lot to like here. Photos: Rupert Fowler - Bike Connection Agency"

        "content": "First Look: Revel Launches 3 New Bikes Including an Enduro & eMTB Model: Revel Bikes is making big moves with three new carbon bikes for 2025. The one that stands out the most is the brand’s first e-bike, the ReRun. It slots into the mid-power category with a Bosch SX motor and 165mm of rear wheel travel. There’s also a new enduro bike, the Ritual, with equal amounts of travel, but no motor. Revel has applied their new “Ratio Fit Philosophy” to this bike, which is designed to provide consistency across sizes (more on that below). In other genres, the Ranger, Revel’s XC whippet, also gets a face-lift with revised geometry and a redesigned rear triangle. Each one of Revel’s full-suspension frames is made of carbon fiber and uses a CBF suspension design, including the ReRun. All of those models piggyback on the recent launch of a lighter, SL version of the Rascal - a much loved, 130mm trail bike. Ranger For 2025, the Ranger has the same intentions, but the geometry has been modernized. The seat tube angle is now 76-degrees and the head tube angle is knocked back to 65.5 - the same number at the front of the Rascal. 2.95 kg / 6.5 lb for a size large frame isn't super light, but then again, this isn't intended to be a World Cup XC race bike. Revel states that the Ranger is all about speed and efficiency without forgoing reliability. Like their other frames, the bearings are now housed in the links. This should make replacing them a less daunting task and reduce possible mechanic errors, like pressing bearings into the carbon seat crooked. Ranger Details • Full carbon frame • Wheel size: 29\" • 115 mm rear travel, 120 mm fork • CBF dual-link suspension design • 65.5° head angle • 76° seat angle (size LG) • 436 mm chainstays • Sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL • Complete weight: 12.75 kg / 28.1 lb (LG - Treeline) • Frame weight: 2.95 kg / 6.5 lb (size LG w/SID Luxe shock) • Price: $4,999 - 8,499 USD • Frame kit: $3,599 USD (w/SID Luxe Ultimate or Fox Float Factory shock) • revelbikes.com Specifications and Pricing Ranger Basecamp - $4,999 USD // Rockshox SID Select P3 fork, SID Select+ shock, DT Swiss M1900 Spline 30 wheels, Race Face Aeffect bar and stem, Shimano Deore brakes and drivetrain, Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper post, Maxxis Forecaster/Rekon 3C EXO tires Ranger Treeline - $6,299 USD // Rockshox SID Select P3 fork, SID Ultimate shock, DT Swiss XM1700 Spline 30 wheels, Race Face Turbine bar and stem, SRAM Motive Silver brakes, SRAM Eagle 90 drivetrain, Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper post, Maxxis Forecaster/Rekon 3C EXO tires ReRun When a bike brand releases an e-bike that doesn't use the same backbone as the rest of the unassisted models, it feels like getting sold short. Thankfully, that's not the case here. Revel has tuned the CBF suspension to work with a motor and the ReRun is built on a full carbon frame to boot. With 165 mm of rear wheel travel and geometry that mimics their new enduro bike, this looks to be a capable machine. ReRun Details • Full carbon frame • Wheel size: MX • 165 mm rear travel, 170 mm fork • Bosch SX motor • 400 Wh battery • CBF dual-link suspension design • 64° head angle • 77° seat angle (size LG) • 442 mm chainstays • Sizes: S, M, L, XL • Complete weight: 20.25 kg / 44.65 lb (LG - Summit) • Price: $8,999 - 10,999 USD • revelbikes.com Motor and Battery Revel has chosen the lower power eMTB route and that typically comes with a lower weight. In this case, the ReRun shaves a few pounds off but isn't quite as light as the Specialized Levo SL. The Bosch SX motor churns out 55 Nm of torque and a 400 Wh battery is integrated into the downtube. For longer rides, the 250 Wh PowerMore Range extender can be added. Geometry The ReRun appears to be have geometry figures which are a solid balance landing somewhere between playful and balanced, without being too grounded or sluggish. That should suit a wide berth of riders and terrain. Unfortunately for taller riders, an XXL frame is omitted from the size range. The chainstays do grow longer and the seat tubes get steeper as the frame size increases, as they should. Specifications and Pricing ReRun Treeline - $8,999 USD // RockShox ZEB Select+ fork, RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate shock, Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro V2 Alloy wheels, SRAM Eagle 90 Transmission, SRAM Maven Silver brakes, Race Face Turbine bar and stem, Continental Kryptotal F&R Enduro, Soft tires ReRun Summit - $10,999 USD // RockShox ZEB Ultimate fork, RockShox Vivid Ultimate shock, Crankbrothers Synthesis Enduro Carbon wheels, SRAM X0 Eagle Transmission, SRAM Maven Silver brakes, Race Face Era bar and Turbine stem, Continental Kryptotal F&R Enduro, Soft tires Ritual If you subtract the motor from the ReRun, you essentially have the Ritual enduro bike. The travel is the same and the geometry only differs by a few millimeters. The major talking point here is that the wheelsize changes with size. MX wheels (29\" front and 27.5\" rear) are used for the size small and medium frames, whereas the large and extra large frames run on dual 29\" wheels. This is what Revel is calling their \"Ratio Fit Philosophy\" which isn't based on geometry, but rear wheel size as well. That means there aren't any flip-chips to allow the larger size Ritual frames to run a smaller rear wheel. Ritual Details • Full carbon frame • Wheel size: MX (SM-MD), 29\" (LG-XL) • 165 mm rear travel, 170 mm fork • CBF dual-link suspension design • 64° head angle • 77° seat angle (size LG) • 438 mm chainstays • Sizes: S, M, L, XL • Complete weight: 15.3 kg / 33.75 lg (LG - Summit) • Frame weight: 3.85 kg / 8.49 lb • Price: $5,899 - 8,999 USD • Frame kit: $3,799 USD (w/ RockShox Vivid Ultimate shock) • revelbikes.com Matt Boughton, Product Manager and Jordan Haffener, Senior Engineer explained that, \"The short answer is: the Large and XL Ritual frames are specifically designed to run a 29” rear wheel, and we recommend sticking with that setup. This design decision is part of our Ratio Fit Philosophy, which focuses on optimizing fit and ride dynamics across all frame sizes. During development, we found that smaller riders (on Small and Medium frames) benefit significantly from a mixed-wheel setup (29” front / 27.5” rear), gaining better maneuverability and more stand-over clearance. This also opened up more freedom for us in achieving the design we set out for with less compromise. On the other hand, taller riders (on Large and XL frames) already benefit from the speed and stability of dual 29” wheels without the compromises a smaller rear wheel introduces. Geometry Like their e-bike, the Ritual is limited to four sizes, omitting a XXL option. With a 508mm reach, the XL frame is said to fit riders from 6'0\"-6'4\".

        "content": "XCO Race Analysis from the 2025 Araxá XC World Cup #1: The 2025 XC World Cup series kicked off with incredible racing in Brazil. The fast and technical Araxá course delivered thrilling racing with standout performances in the elite categories. After a big weekend of racing, let's get into the results and stats. Quick Race Stats U23 Women's Winning Margin: Isabella Holmgren: 19 Seconds U23 Men's Winning Margin: Finn Treudler: 29 Seconds Elite Women's Winning Margin: Samara Maxwell: 4 Seconds Elite Men's Winning Margin: Victor Koretzky: 10 Seconds U23 Women's Winner's Average Speed: Isabella Holmgren - 21.75km/h // 13.52mph U23 Men's Winner's Average Speed: Finn Treudler - 25.75km/h // 16mph Elite Women's Winner's Average Speed: Samara Maxwell - 22.24km/h // 13.82mph Elite Men's Winner's Average Speed: Victor Koretzky - 26.44km/h // 16.43mph U23 Women's Fastest Lap: Valentina Corvi: 10:29.2 ( Lap 1 ) U23 Men's Fastest Lap: Gustav Heby Pedersen: 8:46.5 ( Lap 7 ) Elite Women's Fastest Lap: Nicole Koller: 10:04.4 ( Lap 8 ) Elite Men's Fastest Lap: Lars Forster: 8:25.7 ( Lap 9 ) U23 Women's Top 5/10 % Spread: 3.1% / 4.94% U23 Men's Top 5/10 % Spread: 1.71% / 2.99% Elite Women's Top 5/10 % Spread: 0.56% / 1.15% Elite Men's Top 5/10 % Spread: 0.63% / 0.98% Elite Women's Race Breakdown Samara Maxwell entered the history books as she secured her first elite World Cup win and became the first New Zealand elite woman to win the XCO format. After ensuring she was always near the front of the race in the early laps, Maxwell pulled away on the seventh lap as she quickly built a lead which could not be closed before the finish line. Nicole Koller beat Savilia Blunk to the line to secure second place after both riders had great races to start the 2025 season. Elite Women's Top 5: 1st. Samara Maxwell: 1:24:03 2nd. Nicole Koller: 1:24:07 // +4 3rd. Savilia Blunk: 1:24:07 // +4 4th. Alessandra Keller: 1:24:15 // +12 5th. Candice Lill: 1:24:31 // +28 Story of the Race Top 10 Fastest Laps Across the eight laps during the elite women's race in Araxá, Nicole Koller's flying final lap saw her set the fastest time of the day. Koller's rapid ride to the finish line helped secure second place, closing the gap to race leader Samara Maxwell by 24 seconds. The only rider to come within ten seconds of Koller's top lap time was Savilia Blunk, who went six seconds slower on lap 8. Across the ten fastest times during the elite women's racing, all but one were from either the final or the first lap. Samara Maxwell was the only rider to set the fastest time on a different lap, as her seventh lap made it onto the list. Lap Time Difference Our comparison of each lap found the initial lap produced the closest racing with 10 riders setting the same time. The only other lap with more than two racers completing the lap with the same total time was the second loop around the course, where five riders rode to a time of 10:21. The lap with the largest gap to the fastest rider was Samara Maxwell's seventh lap which featured the attack that propelled her into the lead and toward the XCO victory. Elite Men's Race Breakdown What a race! The elite men's race saw the Specialized Factory Team fill the new three-rider podium with a dominant performance across the nine flat-out laps. Starting from lap one, Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins led from the front, helping each other maintain a growing lead to start the penultimate lap with a 50-second advantage. Koretzky made the race-winning move, pulling away from Blevins before the final lap. Koretzky rode a lonely final lap, crossing the line 10 seconds ahead despite having a slow puncture. Completing the Specialized one-two-three, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann won in a sprint to the line against Lars Forster and Nino Schurter. Elite Men's Top 5: 1st. Victor Koretzky: 1:19:32 2nd. Christopher Blevins: 1:19:42 // +10 3rd. Martin Vidaurre Kossmann: 1:20:01 // +29 4th. Lars Forster: 1:20:02 // +30 5th. Nino Schurter: 1:20:02 // +30 Story of the Race Top 10 Fastest Laps The battle for third place produced the fastest final lap as Lars Forster, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann and Nino Schurter battled for the final spot on the new three-rider podium. The ten fastest times came from the first or last lap, with the race bookended by some fast racing. Nino Schurter was the only rider to register in the top 10 twice, as his first lap before a puncture and furious sprint to the line gave him multiple entries on the list. Lap Time Difference Unlike the women's racing, where there were two laps with more than two racers riding the same lap time, this didn't happen during the elite men's race. Only laps one, two, seven and nine saw two riders achieve the same lap times. Across every lap, the eighth lap from Victor Koretzky, where he launched his attack on teammate Blevins, created the largest gap in lap times with a margin of 1.72%. No other lap saw a gap between the fastest and second-fastest lap times of over 0.77%.

        "title": "Review: 6D Alterra Enduro Full Face Helmet",
        "author": "Matt Beer",
        "date": "04-08-2025",
        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/review-6d-alterra-enduro-full-face-helmet.html",
        "content": "Review: 6D Alterra Enduro Full Face Helmet: 6D is best known in mountain biking for their downhill full-face helmets. Until now, they’ve had a gap between those moto-inspired helmets and an open-face trail lid, the ATB-2T. This new Alterra helmet from 6D is big on safety and venting, but low on weight. Although it looks like an enduro full-face helmet with a removable chin-bar, it is fixed in place. The chin strap incorporates a Fidlock buckle and the adjustable visor stows goggles for on-trail conveniences. The carbon chin-bar, along with all of the other tech built into this helmet, shows how 6D prioritizes safety on all fronts. If you’re familiar with 6D’s patent Omni-Directional Suspension (ODS) system, which is used throughout their helmet line, then you won't’t be surprised to find it in the Alterra too. 6D Alterra Details • Fidlock chin strap closure • Omni-Directional Suspension (ODS) • EPP and EPS construction • Weight: 719 g (actual, size M) • Sizes: XS/S, M/L, XL/XXL (52-62 cm) • 6 color choices • Price: $395 USD • ASTM F1952 DH certified • 6dhelmets.com Safety Features and Certifications This helmet is burly and not the slimmest enduro full-face, despite being fairly light. That means the Alterra helmet exceeds the CPSC/EN1078/AU/NZS 2063 safety standards. Plus, it meets the NTA 8776 E-Bike standard, ASTM F1952 (DH), and ASTM 2023 (BMX) standards. It's currently the top-ranked full face helmet in Virginia Tech's ranking list, although the list of competitors who have also submitted full face helmets for testing is still fairly small. That said, it's still in the eighth spot even when half shell helmets are added into the mix. The ODS is an attractive safety feature. It is said to function differently than any MIPS slip-plane, including the Split Integra system found in the Fox Proframe RS. Two foam layers (EPP and EPS) make up the inside of the Alterra. Those are said to handle impacts of varying forces and are connected via the ODS. Those pieces work as a suspension of sorts to absorb both linear and angular accelerations. On top of that, there’s the multi-impact EPP liner on the inner cup of the shell, and the EPS outside of that. Those two foams are protected by a polycarbonate shell. Up front, an in-molded carbon fiber chin bar adds peace of mind. The Alterra hides one more safety feature; sternum and clavicle crash pads. These are made from a softer EPP foam in hopes of not causing damage to your bones. Performance Fit The Alterra comes in three main shells to span a typical range of heads 53-62 cm in circumference. The XS/S covers 53 to 56 cm, while the M/L from 56 to 59 cm, and the XL/XXL fits 59 to 62 cm. Included with each helmet are three sets of cheek pads, where the medium thickness is installed, but only two head liners and two neck rolls. All of those pads are made from the popular Ionic+ antibacterial fabric. There are also two strips that cover the chin strap as well. I found the stock pad set on the M/L to fit comfortably without squishing my face. Instead, they sit further forward and hold the helmet in place well. Some other lightweight full-faces I’ve tried have gotten this place wrong by placing them on the jaw bone hinge, which can be tiring and even painful after a long day. In terms of shape, the volume inside the Alterra is larger than a Fox Proframe RS, especially towards the top/rear of the head. In some way this is a good attribute because the helmet feels snug and further down over your head. Along the temple area, the Alterra even has a relief for sunglasses if you’re averse to goggles. Adjustment The M/L is without a doubt the correct shell size for me. It’s snug in terms of circumference, but without an occipital retainer, a third and larger volume neck roll included, the fit could be dialled in further for more stability. Up top, the visor can be set to three positions with the middle looking the most balanced. The highest position allows goggles to sit on the brow of the helmet. From there, the goggles never snapped down on my face while climbing or traversing and the strap didn’t slide out of place on the shell. Metal D-rings offer extra security and could be warranted for downhill race speeds, but for enduro riding, the Fidlock buckle closure makes total sense. It’s strong and foolproof. The tension never backed off, which annoyingly, can’t be said for all plastic buckles. One small improvement 6D could make in this area is on the padding around the plastic buckle. When pulled tight, the padding can slip out of the way, leaving the buckle pressing around the jaw bone. It’s not the end of the world and revising the locations of the loops could be a running change. Ventilation Lightweight full-face helmets all seem to have plenty of cut-outs, but there’s something special about the way the air flows into the Alterra, particularly around the forehead and temples. In fact, I’d argue that it’s better than some half-shell helmets. While the daily temperatures haven’t been setting summertime record highs, it has peaked above 20 degrees C a few times. I also noticed that placing the goggles below the visor, or reversing them, didn’t cause them to fog either. Price Historically, 6D helmets haven’t been cheap and the Alterra doesn’t break that mold either. At $395 USD, it’s more expensive than the Fox Proframe RS and POC Otocon by $40, and the Troy Lee Stage by $80. At that price, you also receive a helmet carry sock and those additional pad kits mentioned. Additionally, the Alterra does come with a 3-year limited warranty on manufacturing defects too. For what it’s worth, the Alterra comes in six colorways as well; Gloss Black/White, Matte Military Green, Matte Slate Blue, Matte White/Green, Matte Black, and Matte Sand. Showing off that carbon weave. The brow vents bring in a substantial amount of fresh air. Weight 6D helmets haven’t always been the lightest, but the Alterra is very respectable at 719 grams. Considering the safety security offered by the ODS system, they’ve done well to drop the weight below a top competitor, the Fox Proframe RS (820 g). The Troy Lee Designs Stage is still 35 grams lighter and the Specialized Gambit is in another league at just 620 grams. The visor is small and narrow in comparison to the rest of the helmet volume. The visor smoothly snaps up a notch or two to stow goggles. Pros + Impressive venting + ODS system doesn’t squeak Cons - Chin strap padding slides to side - Additional padding may be needed to refine fit Pinkbike's Take 6D has sparked my interest in lightweight full-face helmets with the Alterra. Its Omni-Directional Suspension system jockeys for top spot amongst other multi-directional and variable force impact designs. Plus, the weight and price are very competitive in that field. Some experimentation with pad kits might be needed to find the ideal fit though. — Matt Beer"

The American version requires helmets to withstand slightly greater impact forces, and this results in around 60 g more weight in this case. Below are the claimed weights for each size and safety accreditation: Sizing: • S: 52-56 cm (CE 330g – CPSC 380g) • M: 56-59 cm (CE 360g – CPSC 420g) • L: 59-61 cm (CE 400g – CPSC 460g) The Kassis comes with a passive reflector as standard, plus an optional USB-rechargeable LED rear light for extra safety on the roads. The light costs an extra £29.99 / $29.99 / €29,00 and has a claimed run time of 90-180 minutes. Both the light and reflector are removable. It's available in White, Dark Navy and Mud-Sand, with a retail price of £189.99 / $199.99 USD / €200,00 / CAD 289.99 fizik.com"

        "content": "[UPDATED] 2025 Araxá XCO World Cup #1 Results, Highlights & Series Standings: Race Highlights Course Fly-Through: The results are in from the first XC World Cup of the year after some incredible racing in Brazil. Kicking off the first XCO World Cups of 2025, we saw dominant performances from the U23 racers, with Isabella Holmgren and Finn Treudler ending their races with big gaps to 2nd place. Samara Maxwell enters the history books as she not only secured her first elite World Cup win but also the first for a New Zealand elite woman in the XCO format. After ensuring she was always near the front of the race in the early laps, Maxwell pulled away on the seventh lap as she quickly built a small lead which could not be closed before the finish line. Nicole Koller just beat Savilia Blunk to the line to secure second place after both riders had great races to start the 2025 season. What a race! The elite men's race saw the Specialized Factory Team fill the new three-rider podium with a dominant performance across the nine flat-out laps. Starting from lap one, the pair of Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins led from the front, helping each other maintain a growing lead to start the penultimate lap with a 50-second advantage. It was Koretzky who made the race-winning move, pulling away from Blevins before the final lap to go it alone as he crossed the line 10 seconds ahead despite having a slow puncture. Completing the Specialized one-two-three, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann won in a sprint to the line against Lars Forster and Nino Schurter. Check out the results and race updates below.

Simon Andreassen leads the large chase group trying to catch the Specialized team riders. 11:45 PDT: The Lead Grows to 23 Seconds What a start to today's racing from Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins and they have blown apart the front of the race. With over seven laps remaining, it will be tough to keep this pace up. 11:46 PDT: A Bad Start for Nino Schurter After being amongst the chasing group Nino Schurter has dropped down to 42nd place, over a minute behind the leaders. 11:48 PDT: Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins Ahead by 35 Seconds After Lap 2 With two laps down, the Specialized team riders have created a massive 35-second lead against the chasing group. 11:53 PDT: Max Brandl closes the Lead to 23 Seconds The chase group are pulling in the race leaders as the gap shrinks to 23 seconds. 11:57 PDT: Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins Ahead by 19 Seconds After Lap 3 With three laps completed, the Specialized team riders have seen their lead shrink by 16 seconds.

After the first part of the climb on lap four, the lead is up to 24 seconds after starting the lap with a 19-second advantage. 12:03 PDT: Koretzky Starting to Show an Advantage Over Blevins It looks like Victor Koretzky is riding stronger than Christopher Blevins as the pair continue their assault upon the Brazilian course. After completing most of the climbing on lap four, the leading pair are 34 seconds ahead. 12:05 PDT: Koretzky and Blevins Start Lap 5 41 Seconds Ahead After it looked like the leading pair may get caught on the lap four, the Specialized teammates now have an even larger advantage with 41 seconds back to another Specialized rider, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann. 12:15 PDT: Another Lap Sees the Leaders Go 50 Seconds Ahead Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins have added to their lead on lap five with a gap of 50 seconds to third-placed Luca Schwarzbauer. 12:16 PDT: A Group of 17 Chase the Leaders While the leaders are far out in front there is a huge collection of 17 riders battling for the role of lead chaser. 12:19 PDT: Nino Schurter Up to 20th After he dropped outside the top 40, Nino Schurter has ridden back to 20th place. 12:20 PDT: Charlie Aldridge has Pulled Out of the Race Charlie Aldridge will not continue today's racing. It is unclear why he has pulled out of the race. 12:24 PDT: The Lead Grows to 53 Seconds After Lap 6 The current race leaders, Victor Koretzky and Christopher Blevins, are still over 50 seconds ahead of the chase group with three laps to the finish line. 12:25 PDT: Nino Schurter Catches the Chasing Group Nino Schurter has ridden back from disaster as he joins the battle for third place. 12:33 PDT: The Gap to the Leaders Remains Unchanged After Lap 7 Heading into the penultimate lap, the chasing group made no gains against the leading Specialized teammates on lap seven. 12:35 PDT: Specialized Team Riders Fill the Top 4 The Specialized Factory team now holds the top four positions, as Victor Koretzky is also starting to ride away from Christopher Blevins. 12:36 PDT: Victor Koretzky Builds an 8-Second Lead Victor Koretzky is now eight seconds ahead of Christopher Blevins as the pair are split for the first time in the race. 12:41 PDT: Victor Koretzky Starts the Final Lap with a 9-Second Advantage Victor Koretzky has started the final lap of an incredible race with just nine seconds between him and teammate Christopher Blevins. The pair is relatively safe from the chasing group with a gap of 1 minute to third. 12:43 PDT: Victor Koretzky 17 Seconds Ahead Victor Koretzky is upping the pace again as he grows the lead to 17 seconds. 12:46 PDT: Nino Schurter Fighting Martin Vidaurre Kossmann for 3rd Nino Schurter is pushing hard to pass Martin Vidaurre Kossmann as he is hungry for a top result after falling outside the top 40 earlier in the race. 12:49 PDT: Victor Koretzky Takes the Win After an impressive performance leading through all nine laps, Koretzky takes the race victory in Brazil.

        "content": "WTB Announces New Solano & Rocket Saddles: PRESS RELEASE: WTB WTB is proud to announce the introduction of three innovative saddle designs that will further advance our mission of creating the most state-of-the-art saddles on the market. All new saddles feature WTB’s Fusion Form technology, allowing engineers to fine-tune the base of each specific model to create a flex profile that balances comfort, support and durability to match the intended use of each individual saddle. Solano: Performance Meets Comfort The Solano is a high-performance saddle designed for riders who demand superior comfort and support on medium to long rides. Engineered with advanced features and premium materials, the Solano Saddle is built to keep you comfortable and composed, even during the most demanding of efforts. The Solano Saddle is best suited to riders who push hard on the pedals while maintaining a consistent seated position. Too much padding can often leave these riders feeling unsupported on longer rides, so the firm Fusion Form base and enhanced padding found on both the Solano and Solano SL combine to deliver isolated support for the sit bones while reducing perineal and frontal pressure. The Solano features 4 mm of additional padding under the sit bones, compared to the Solano SL, and 2 mm thicker padding in the middle and nose, providing increased comfort for longer rides—even for those who prefer to ride without a chamois. The short length, low-profile padding, and rounded tail also allow riders to move freely when out of the saddle, making the Solano the perfect blend of comfort and versatility. Offered in medium or wide widths. Solano SL: Minimal Padding, Maximum Support Next, we have the Solano SL – a saddle designed for riders demanding supreme comfort during shorter, more intense rides. Pushing hard on the pedals while staying seated puts less weight through the rider's sit bones, so less padding is needed to achieve optimal comfort. It’s for this reason that the Solano SL features thinner padding than the Solano, resulting in an overall lighter saddle with a slimmer profile. Much like the Solano, the Solano SL features a flatter profile, making it a great option for riders who tend to rotate their pelvis under high pedalling loads. Its firmer Fusion Form base and thinner padding isolates support to the sit bones, reducing unwanted perineal and frontal pressure. The Solano SL delivers unmatched support and freedom of movement, making it the ideal companion for dynamic cycling adventures. Rocket: Long Lasting Comfort and Support The all-new Rocket saddle is designed to deliver unparalleled comfort and support for mountain bikers seeking peak performance on long rides. Engineered with innovative features and crafted from premium materials, the Rocket is the ultimate choice for riders who demand durability, functionality, and long-lasting comfort. The side profile of the Rocket reveals a generous curvature from tip to tail, designed to cradle riders who like to stay planted in the saddle – especially when the trail points uphill. The Rocket’s climbing support is further increased by the discreet Backstop feature. A hidden ramp built into the tail of the saddle, providing a supportive surface to brace against during the steepest of climbs. Under the base and to the rear, the Rocket also features an integrated handle to make lifting heavy bikes onto racks or over obstacles as smooth and effortless as possible. The concealed handle, supportive Backstop, and rounded tail make the Rocket saddle a great choice for MTB and e-MTB riders alike, providing plentiful comfort and control in the most demanding terrain. Availability All WTB saddles are priced according to their rail materials. Available saddle rail material options vary depending on the saddle, but MSRP remains the same for each rail material. MSRP is $49.95/€49.90/£50.00 for steel, $95.95/€94.90/£95.00 for cromoly, $109.95/€109.00/£110.00 for stainless, $119.95/€119.00/£120.00 for titanium and $209.95/€209.00/£210.00 for carbon. All three saddles are available at WTB.com and dealers across Europe and North America."

        "content": "Final Results: iXS EDC in Santiago de Besteiros, Portugal: Press Release: Racement After the first iXS European Downhill Cup race of the season started with continuous rain on Friday and the forecast didn't look much better at the beginning. The weather gods seemed to be a fan of downhill racing after all and provided dry conditions on the following two days, which were appropriate for the event. The organizers of the Portuguese race in Santiago de Besteiros provided a first-class event with a thoroughly challenging course. Result Men After setting the fastest time in the seeding run, Nathan Pontvianne (FRA - Goodman Santa Cruz) once again came out on top with a time of 2:37.282 minutes. The 2023 European Junior Champion relegated his teammate, Thomas Estaque (FRA) to second place. Ethan Craik (GBR - Scott DH Factory) finished third. Result Women As expected, Valentina Höll (AUT - YT Mob) was the big winner today, ahead of Veronika Widmann (ITA - Mondraker Factory Racing) and Mathilde Bwernhard (FRA - G2 Racing Project). However, we would like to shine the spotlight on the second row, and we know that Vali supports this, as her career also began in our series more than ten years ago. For some time now, a young girl has been catching our eye, and today, she once again drove herself into the limelight. Rosa Marie Jensen (DEN - GEN-S) won the U17 class with a time close to that of the world champion and would have finished second in the elite class. Rosa Zierl (GER - Cube Young Guns) was similarly eye-catching and also proved quite well what class she is capable of on this difficult weekend. Of course, the iXS European Cup is not the World Cup, where a lot of prize money is at stake and every result carries enormous weight. We are not a workplace for professional cyclists, but a springboard for careers and a platform where friendships are made for life. It's the weekend together that counts and that indescribable feeling when you drive home with your buddies on the highway on a Sunday night and a race full of highs and lows is behind you. We deliver the races that make our sport what it is. It's not just about results, it's about passion. We don't need a petition for a five-place podium, if that's what you want, we'll just do it. And the result often doesn't matter on the Monday after, the main thing is that you've done your best and had a great time in beautiful places.

        "content": "Framed: Squamish Winter MTB Photo Project: Photography and Words - Joe Wakefield Riders - Patrik Chomist & Austin Kasparlov & Honza Winter Frozen loam and fog-drenched forests – a different kind of Squamish ride season. Winter riding here isn’t for the faint of heart — it’s wet, dark, and bone-deep cold. But it’s also quiet, raw, and strangely beautiful. With less tire traffic and more puddles than people, the forest turns into a mood board of greens, browns, and soft-filtered fog. This winter, I set out to document mountain biking in Squamish when it’s at its quietest. The idea was simple: take the camera out during the months most people stay in or Ski. Cold, wet, foggy days — the type where the light disappears by 3 p.m. and your gloves are soaked before you even hit the trailhead. But those are also the days when Squamish looks completely different. The forest gets heavy with moisture. Fog drapes over the trees. Steam rises off riders like they’re boiling over. And with the help of off-camera flash, I wanted to capture that mood — to show these trails in a way we don’t normally see them. There’s something surreal about shooting in the dead of winter — Steam rising off the rider like smoke, the forest transformed into a quiet, misty world that feels nothing like summer. It’s the same trails, but they look and feel completely different. Slippery slabs and no margin for error — perfect riding conditions, depending who you ask! WHY SHOOT WINTER? If you're willing to brave the elements, Squamish still delivers. The granite slabs stay grippy. The dirt holds traction. And the crowds? They’re gone. There’s no golden hour glow, no dry berms kicking up hero dirt, no bluebird backdrops. Winter strips it all down. What’s left is just the rider, the trail, and the mood — and that’s exactly what I wanted to capture. The way the forest breathes in winter is completely different. Every sound is softer. Every pedal stroke echoes a bit louder. The fog hangs low and thick, acting like a natural diffuser. It’s cinematic without trying to be. Add in the flash, and suddenly what’s usually a dark, grey day becomes dramatic — shadows, highlights, shapes that would be invisible in summer. And honestly? Shooting in these conditions is just more rewarding. The cold makes every shot feel earned. There’s no “spray and pray” here — just patience, timing, and a willingness to get your socks soaked for the sake of a frame that actually says something. WHY FLASH? Using flash let me control the scene in a way that natural light couldn’t during the dark winter days. It helped define features, carve out the riders from the background, and give that surreal look to moments that would otherwise be swallowed in grey. Sometimes the best light comes when the sun never really shows up! These photos aren’t just about aesthetics — they’re about potential. Squamish has always been a destination for summer riding, but the winter months offer their own kind of magic. As long as you’ve got layers, Mudguards, and maybe a sense of humor, there’s still world-class riding to be had. No lift lines. No shuttle queues. Just you, your bike, and a trail slick enough to keep you honest. RESPECT TO THE RIDERS Winter riding isn’t just harder — it’s riskier, colder, and far less forgiving. So when someone agrees to head out for a shoot in these conditions, I don’t take that lightly. The riders in this project didn’t just show up — they *showed up prepared*. Layered up, tire pressures dialed, brake pads fresh, lines pre-walked. They knew the margins were thin: wet slabs and Icy drops. Riding this stuff clean takes serious skill. Riding it while being chased flashed by strobes? Even more so. Their commitment made this project what it is. I can fire flashes and line up compositions all day, but none of it matters without riders who trust the process — and trust me to capture it. This whole series is as much a tribute to their grit and the Trailbuilders keeping these areas in working running order, year round! Looking Ahead This project was a reminder that even when the days are short and the skies stay grey, the ride — and the story — doesn’t stop. Winter might not be the obvious season for mountain biking, but it has a beauty all its own. As the days get longer and the sun starts to stick around a little more, I’m already looking forward to another year chasing bikes, light, and everything in between. We acknowledge that we are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Squamish Nation. We recognize and respect them in this territory, as well as their historic connection to the lands and waters around us since time immemorial."

        "content": "A Homemade, High Pivot, Lugged Carbon Trail Bike - Sea Otter 2025: I stumbled across this bike during one of my dazed wanders through the hazy California sun at Sea Otter. It nearly slipped by unnoticed—until the sunlight caught a glint of what looked suspiciously like a plethora of Kashima coating. Intrigued, I followed the sparkle and found a custom trail bike unlike anything else on the grounds. Turns out, the bike—and the story—belong to Logan Olsen, a machinist-turned-framebuilder who quietly put together this stunning creation in his Humboldt County workshop. If the name rings a bell, you might know him from Logan Olson Putters , the boutique brand behind some seriously premium golf putters—until TaylorMade scooped it up not long ago. Now, Logan’s putting his precision machining skills toward bikes. And judging by the detail on this build, it’s a seriously good use of time. “This was sort of my four-month side project,” Logan says, gesturing casually to the matte carbon and anodized gold machine beside him. “It’s a big trail bike—or a small enduro bike, maybe. 160mm up front and 150mm in the back.” Built around a four-bar linkage design with a unified rear triangle and low mid-pivot idler, this bike hits all the 2025 bike nerd bingo in one. The entire rear end is CNC-machined from 7075 aluminum, then anodized by hand—yes, including that shimmering Kashima-esque gold details scattered throughout. All of the frame’s connecting points are also machined from 7075, while the tubing is carbon fiber. It’s a blend of handmade craftsmanship and future-forward tech, with carbon wheels and bars rounding out the build. For someone whose background includes building some of the cleanest milled putters in the business, it’s no surprise that this frame looks so dialed. The lines are clean, the machining is top-notch, and the overall aesthetic lands somewhere between raw prototype and finished art piece. Olsen built it all in his shop in Humboldt County, California—a zone better known for redwoods and surf than custom bikes. But if this is what he’s whipping up as a side project, we’d love to see what happens if he takes on bikes full-time. Don't get your hopes up; it didn't seem like Logan had any plans to jump into the bike manufacturing business anytime soon. Hopefully, this won’t be the last we see of Logan Olsen’s two-wheeled creations."

        "content": "Cane Creek's Prototype Inverted Fork - Sea Otter 2025: Not content to let Fox hog all of the inverted fork hype at Sea Otter, Cane Creek revealed a prototype upside-down fork of their own today. No strangers to the USD fork concept (their Invert gravel fork launched last spring), Cane Creek are hoping that the new fork will slot into their lineup as an option for enduro and eMTB riders looking for more travel than the Helm. The fork is still in the development stage, with a launch likely taking place some time next year. Details are still thin, again due to the fact that it's still a work in progress, but this version is air sprung, with a 15mm hegagonal axle. No word on travel amounts, but I'd imagine it'll be in the 170mm range. There are dials on the top and bottom of the right leg for rebound and compresison adjustments, and what are presumably bleed valves on the back of the crown. Stanchion guards bolt to the machined dropouts, as does the brake line guide on the left leg. What's behind the sudden resurgence of inverted forks? We've seen the concept attempted multiple times in the past, but this time around it seems like there are more options than ever being released or in the works, and not just from small boutique brands. Realistically, motors are part of the answer - e-bikers are less likely to stress over taking the weight penalty that typically accompanies an inverted design in order to achieve an appropriate level of stiffness. The same goes for riders on enduro bikes - grams aren't being counted as closely as they once were, at least not if the performance is there to justify installing a heavier fork, shock, or any other component. Upside down forks can also be easier to produce, as Matt Beer mentioned in his predictions article back in 2024 - the design eliminates the need for expensive castings for magnesium lowers."

        "content": "First Ride: 2025 Santa Cruz Bullit: The Santa Cruz Bullit is one of the few eMTBs to have gained something of a cult status, as one of the first long-travel options to manage weight and travel in a manner that had some riders leaving the shuttle rig behind. Years later, they're back with a full overhaul of the platform, and things look quite a bit different. No longer using the VPP suspension platform, the Bullit now features a Horst link rear end to deliver its 170mm of travel. Like Santa Cruz's other recent release, the Vala , the Bullit uses a Bosch Line CX motor, as well as a 600Wh battery. Bullit Details • 170mm frame travel, 170mm fork • Mixed wheels 27.5\"/29\" • C or CC carbon frame • 63.6° head angle • 600Wh battery • 85 Nm torque, 600 W max power • High/low and progression flip chips • Price: $7,399 – $11,899 USD • Weight: 50.0lb / 22.7kg (XL bike) • santacruzbicycles.com Frame Details Carbon fiber, mixed wheels, and 170mm of travel is the case across all 5 sizes of the Bullit, regardless of the build kit you choose. All the bikes come in under 50 pounds in the Medium size as well, which is pretty impressive considering the power and travel on tap. Santa Cruz is offering the Bullit in both C and CC frame options, which differentiate in weight and the ability to run a cable-actuated drivetrain. The latter may bug some, but luckily the C level frame is functionally identical and just as available. Other frame details are as well integrated as you'd expect of the brand, with an easily accessed geometry flip chip at the seatstay-rocker link pivot point, and a small progression flip chip at the lower shock mount. All of the hardware is easy to nip up with a multitool, though I've had no issues with bolts coming loose over the test so far. Thanks to the move to a Horst link suspension layout, dropper insertion is massive on the bike, with a 240mm easily fitting in the XL I've been testing. Water bottle fitment is also a breeze, with room for either a large bottle or a Bosch PowerMore bolt-on battery pack. That boost pack will give you an extra 250Wh of juice, if the stock 600Wh isn't enough. Otherwise, the frame is pleasantly simple. The 660Wh battery is hard-mounted, and doesn't feature any hot swap potential, but is also perfectly quiet and feels solid. The Bosch CX motor is similarly quiet, with a pretty light whine compared to most of the other full-power options out there. The 85Nm max torque feels accessible and easy to control, and the 600W max power gets you up some pretty ridiculous pitches with ease. I'm a big fan of the controls integration Bosch created, with a Bluetooth remote that's easy to access without being in the way of your dropper or grip. Suspension Design The big news came with the Vala, but it's just as significant on this front. Santa Cruz chose to forgo their long-synonymous VPP suspension layout in favor of the more common Horst link design, primarily due to packaging constraints and desired kinematic outputs. The engineers at Santa Cruz have been able to eke out some impressive performance from the VPP system, but there are some inherent benefits to a 4-bar design like the one used here. The performance while braking feels optimized for the use case, and the different pedaling characteristic suits the eMTB context nicely. Folks who want to toy with suspension feel will be able to adjust the progression via a simple flip chip at the lower shock mount, with a Hi/Lo progression mode to suit different terrain, riding styles, and shock choices. I generally preferred the Lo progression mode, as the sensation of support felt more consistent in the top end of travel, with enough progression to avoid any harsh bottom-outs. The Hi progression mode is noticeably softer initially, and had me firming compression at the shock to find a happier balance, with sag set at the same level. Though none of the builds come with a coil shock, the higher progression mode will probably suit that linear shock feel, though really I don't think the bike needs help with the sensitivity you get out of a coil shock. I reached out to Kiran MacKinnon, Santa Cruz's PM of Suspension and Ride Quality, to get a sense of how the Bullit stacks up to their broader lineup of bikes. The Bullit's leverage has a familiar Santa Cruz feel to it, being quite straight and progressive. The curve has a small amount of what we call \"belly\" in the shape which gives the bike increased ride height without building too much feedback once the bike is deeper in the travel. We enjoy consistency, so whatever shapes we employ to the leverage curve are intentional and used pretty sparingly. We believe in low anti-squat values to allow the suspension to move with limited interference from the drivetrain, both for descending and climbing traction. The Bullit has a low and regressive anti-squat figure to help the bike remain stable in pedaling segments of travel, but also reduce drivetrain interference on bigger hits. In taller gears on the cassette, the Bullit intentionally produces lower anti-squat values to further descending sensitivity compared to shorter gears, which produce higher values for climbing support. Anti-rise is very consistent as the Bullit uses travel. We targeted a 70% AR value which strikes what we think is a nice balance between sensitivity and geo preservation. When tuning anti-rise, we're also looking for a value high enough to provide a platform for the rider to push into when slowing the bike quickly. — Kiran MacKinnon Geometry Like just about every Santa Cruz out there, the Bullit features a high/low flip chip to adjust the geometry of the bike. I'll refer to things in the high mode, as that's where I've preferred things recently. The head angle sits at 63.6°, and the seat angle at 78.7°, with an effective angle of around 77.4° for the average pedaling height. Reach figures range from 435mm on the Small to 525mm on the Extra Large, with 20mm gaps through the middle three sizes. Stack heights range from 622-270mm, with larger jumps as you climb up the size range. Rear center lengths grow by 3mm per size, from 440-452mm. I've been riding the XL bike, and have been pretty pleased with the fit overall. I'm running the stem up at the top of the steer tube to gain a bit more stack, but otherwise haven't had to fuss with much. One detail worth noting that feels geometry adjacent is the stock crank length on the bikes, with stubby 155mm arms across the board. As the bike dynamically rides pretty low, this makes a big difference in how easily you can pedal the hog up tech climbs, and allows for some pretty goofy uphill maneuvers. Build Kits There are four build kits on offer for the Bullit - three C and one CC. Three come with a Float X tuned for the bike, with the top end build featuring the new Float X2. Prices range from $7,399 to $11,899 USD, with no frame-only option to speak of. The Bullit C 70 retails for $7,399 and features an Eagle 70 drivetrain, Zeb base fork, DB8 brakes, and Reserve alloy wheels. The Bullit C 90 retails for $8,599 and features an Eagle 90 drivetrain, Fox 38 Performance fork, Maven Base brakes, and Reserve alloy wheels. Ride Impressions I've been riding a Bullit C GX AXS at home for the past few weeks, and was able to hop on the XO AXS RSV bike for one ride in Santa Cruz. Both were XL, which fits me just about perfectly, and both were pleasantly easy to set up. The geometry of the bike feels very well suited to keeping you in a neutral pocket between the wheels, with plenty of stability to lean on if you get out of shape. Dynamically, I preferred the feeling of the bike in the Lo progression mode, as the suspension platform has more of a predictable curve to it, without any wasted travel. The Hi mode caters well to steeper trails where you want a very safe feeling body position, but does benefit from more compression on the shock if you're looking to balance that active top end with more support through the stroke. The bike is quiet, calm, and doesn't hide the travel on tap - folks looking for a zippy trail bike should look elsewhere, perhaps even at Santa Cruz's Vala. Comparing those two will be a full project for a later date, but suffice to say they both have their merits. The Vala feels plenty capable for the gnarliest terrain, but you'll have to rely a bit more on skill to keep things in check. The Bullit is a heavier safety blanket, with a bit more traction and a planted feel to it. I don't fault Santa Cruz for keeping the stack height of the bike in a fairly typical place, but can't help but wonder how much more you could get out of the thing with a slightly higher front end. I'm running the stem at the top of the steer tube, and will experiment with some high rise bars to push the reach back out a little ways. The Low geometry mode does give you a bigger rider area, but comes with some small compromises on maneuverability and clearance. More on that with the long term review, all in due time."

        "content": "First Look: Intend Moto V2 Air-Coil Hybrid Shock & Inverted Fork: Intend, the German boutique brand, has launched its most unique and exclusive suspension set yet. The Moto V2 kit is designed for enduro riding and includes the Edge Blackline inverted fork with sliding bushings, but the real innovation is the new shock with a hybrid coil/air spring system. The shock comes with a one-size-fits-all 135 lb/in coil spring; this is supplemented by an adjustable air spring which also pressurises the damping fluid. The air has a minimum pressure of 200 psi to ensure consistent damping, and this sets the lower limit of rider weight to 85 kg. Lighter riders won't be able to get the combined spring rate soft enough while maintaining the damping pressure. According to Intend, the advantage of this approach is to improve sensitivity compared to an air spring while maintaining tunability. The air spring can be adjusted in the normal way to fine-tune the spring rate (above that 200 psi minimum) and accept volume spacers to control the end-stroke ramp. Intend Moto V2 Details: Fork - Sliding Bushings - Blackline Lower legs + blades - Hard anodized upper tubes - 180/203/220mm PM Brake Mount - 15mm Axle - 150-180mm travel Shock - 205x65 Trunnion / 230x65 thanks to IBS - 62,5mm / 60mm / 57,5mm stroke possible with stroke reduction - hybrid coil spring/air spring - full air spring tuneability (pressure/volume tokens) - includes 135lbs Eibach coil spring - recommended rider weight: 85-130kg (min. air spring pressure: 200PSI) Kit Price (fork & shock): 3650.42€ net / 4344€ incl. 19% VAT Intend says the coil provides roughly one-third of the spring force. This is a key distinction to the Cane Creek Tigon , which employs an air chamber to add end-stroke support to an interchangeable coil spring which does the heavy lifting. The Moto V2's air spring is similar to Intend's Hover air shock, with its own negative chamber to ensure the shock doesn't top out at higher pressures. The small coil spring is said to make the overall spring curve a little more linear and the hybrid shock suits heavier riders (up to 130 kg) better than the air-only Hover shock (which is designed for riders up to 110 kg). While it's heavier than the Hover, its claimed weight is comparable to some air shocks, at 580 g including the coil. It also features a clever interchangeable mounting bracket that can switch between 205x65 Trunnion or 230x65 \"regular\" mounting standards. Intend call this IBS (Interchangeable Bridge System), which may be an unfortunate acronym among English speakers. Shock stroke can be reduced down to 57.5 mm in 2.5 mm increments. While the shock's rider weight range may put some people off, the price is out of reach for most too. There's no way to sugarcoat this: it's €4344 (inc VAT) for the fork and shock. Only ten sets will be made for now. Intend clearly isn't concerned with mass-market appeal - only pushing the envelope and questioning how things are done. intend-bc.com Intend's promo video for those who speak German."

        "content": "Praxis Unveils New Folding Cog Gearbox - Sea Otter 2025: Stepping outside their typical product realm, Praxis has come out swinging with a truly novel gearbox concept: the HiT. The HiT can be configured with 4 to 16 gears, and is a fully internal chain-driven set of size-changing cogs. Those cogs change size via a novel hinging concept, and the entire system can be shifted under load. Praxis had a 4-speed variant in a clear case to give a better glimpse into what's going on inside the HiT. Thanks to the little jockey wheel and size-changing cogs, the chain is always in line, and won't generate further drag or mis-shift as a result. This version is using an industrial chain, but the system could be packaged a bit smaller by opting for a custom chain that reduces the roller sizing. The output cog can be located in various spots around the gearbox, allowing for quite a bit of flexibility on pivot location and drivetrain orientation. Praxis is currently developing the project on a few fronts; bike development with interested OE partners is key, as is further field testing of the system to make sure things hold up in the long term. They're also pursuing the concept in tandem with a mid-drive e-bike motor, to bring the concept to all sorts of bikes. More information at the Praxis website ."

For Holmgren, this continues her perfect start to the 2025 season after winning the XCC and XCO races last weekend. Evie Richards remains the rider to beat for women's XCC Short Track racing in 2025 as she takes another race victory. Richards has now become the most successful elite women's XCC Short Track racer, breaking Pauline Ferrand Prevot's record after winning a sprint to the line against Nicole Koller and Jenny Rissveds. Koller rode a great race as she launched an attack on the final climb, taking the lead before the final descent and giving her an advantage to beat Jenny Rissveds for 2nd. It's another Specialized one-two in the elite men's racing as Christopher Blevins repeated his round one victory, crossing the line five seconds ahead. Becoming the second elite male racer to win the first two XCC rounds of a season, Blevins was unmatched in the final stages of the race, after a huge attack on the final climb saw him open a gap which could not be closed by his teammate Victor Koretzky.

        "content": "First Look: FSA's Lightweight Gradient Gravity Carbon Wheels & Components: FSA is perhaps better known for its asphalt-oriented line of components as sponsors of several professional road cycling teams. They have, however, been toiling away in the mountain bike space as well - since 1993. Their most recent additions include carbon and alloy handlebars, stems, a crankset and a carbon wheelset, developed alongside Atherton Racing. The standout item comes in the form of the Gradient i30 carbon DH wheels, weighing a claimed 1,869 grams for a 29\" set and retailing at $1,420 USD. That is both very light and very cheap for an ASTM 5-certified carbon wheelset that is sold with a lifetime warranty. FSA Gradient i30 Carbon Wheels • Size: 29\" • Intended use: DH (ASTM 5) • Rim Internal Width: 30mm width • External Width: 37mm • Depth: 22mm-24mm • 4mm asymmetric rim bed • Hubs: Power-Ratchet System X-900 w/ 72 POE • 28 Straight-Pull Spokes, 6-bolt rotors • Freehubs: Microspline and XD • Weight: 1,869 g (claimed) • MSRP:  € 1.498 / $1,420 USD / £ 1,499 • More info: fullspeedahead.com Not a press release goes by without use of the word compliance, and it's no different here in the case of FSA. Their new i30 wheels roll on carbon rims with a 30mm internal width, and a staggered rim depth varying from 22mm to 24mm. That relatively shallow rim depth are said to increase flexibility in the rim allowing it to absorb shock and conform to the terrain better, as compared to a deeper stiffer rim. The Gradient i30 gets 28 spokes, front and rear, of the straight-pull variety. The rims are laced to FSA's own hubs with 72T POE - giving engagement every 5°. FSA tell us the servicing of these hubs does not require use of any proprietary tools. The so-called turrets at the spoke insertion points are said to strengthen the anchoring of the nipples and reduce the weight between them. And that's where this wheelset is most impressive: a claimed weight of 1,869 grams for a 29\" wheelset is light. It's lighter than any DH-rated wheelsets from Crankbrothers, E*Thirteen and ENVE, and considerably more affordable, too. Needless to say, our interest is piqued. Your man Dario will be putting these to the test over the coming months. Also launching this week are new Gradient handlebars, stems, and an alloy crankset, too. The crank arms are a two-piece affair, forged and cnc-machined such that when they are bonded together it leaves a hollow space inside. It has a forged 30mm spindle, and is rated for Enduro and DH. It weighs a claimed 620 grams. FSA says these are 40% stronger than the KFX cranks. They are also cnc-machining the narrow-wide chainrings for this crankset - available in 30T-36T variants. A chainring is included in the $330 USD RRP. These seem to be a solid option, though it's a miss for FSA not to have offered crank arms shorter than 165mm. New aluminum and carbon riser bars are added to the Gradient line, both available in 31.8mm and 35mm. All are 800mm wide with an 8° backsweep and a 5° upsweep, but only the aluminum ones are available in higher rise options. The carbon bar weighs a claimed 240 grams and is available in a 20mm or a 30mm rise, retailing at $149 USD. Oh, and it is said to have superior vibration damping properties to keep hand and arm fatigue in check. The alloy bar is of course considerably heavier but not exactly hefty at a claimed 322 grams. Its profile is butted along the length of the bar to increase... you guessed it, compliance. This one is available in 25mm and 40mm rise options, and goes for $85 USD. Rounding out the cockpit is a new cnc-machined 6061 aluminum stem with a 6° upsweep. It is a no-gap design, available in both 35mm and 31.8mm clamp varieties, with 33mm, 45mm and 50mm reach options. It weighs a claimed 180 grams in the 31.8mm x 50mm option. Last but not least there is a direct-mount option, too. It too is a 6061 aluminum piece available in both 31.8mm and 35mm. The 31.8mm option has a fixed reach of 45mm, while the 35mm has an adjustable reach from 45mm to 50mm. Claimed weight is 154 grams and it goes for 109 EUR."

        "content": "[UPDATED] 2025 Araxá XCO World Cup #2 Results, Series Standings & Race Highlights: Race Highlights The results are in from the second XC World Cup of the year after more incredible racing in Brazil. Kicking off the second round of XCO World Cup racing, we saw repeat dominant performances from Isabella Holmgren and Finn Treudler as they secured back-to-back wins in Brazil. Jenny Rissveds takes her first victory in 2025 after an early attack on lap four saw her power into the lead and never look back. After struggling to match the high speeds at round one, Rissveds came out fighting for the second stop of the 2025 World Cup series. Rissveds was unmatched on the climbs and descents, with ferocious lap times helping her cross the line 28 seconds ahead of round one winner Samara Maxwell. Following Maxwell, XCC short track winner for rounds one and two, Evie Richards, took her first XCO podium of the season. Christopher Blevins achieved his first perfect XC World Cup weekend as he followed up the XCC Short Track win with the XCO victory. After some nail-biting racing with no rider in the leading group able to secure an advantage into the final lap, it was the Specialized team who moved into formation for the main climb, with Blevins, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann and Adrien Boichis breaking away as they headed into the second half of the lap. In an all-out Specialized team sprint finish, Blevins overpowered his teammates to cross the line two seconds ahead of Vidaurre Kossmann and Boichis. Check out the results and race updates below.

It seems like no one wants to do the work on the final flat part of the lap, allowing the race to come back together before starting the next lap. 9:19 PDT: Rissveds Creates a Gap on the Climb Again Jenny Rissveds is looking strong on the climbs again as she uses the fourth lap climb to create another gap to the chasing riders. This time, it is just three seconds, so this could be closed in the second half of the lap. 9:24 PDT: Rissveds Maintains a 12-Second Lead into Lap 5 Jenny Rissveds is working hard to keep her advantage as she starts the fifth lap with a 12-second lead against the chase group led by Loana Lecomte. 9:24 PDT: Maxwell Takes Control of the Chase Group In an effort to catch the race leader, Samara Maxwell is pushing hard to close the gap to Jenny Rissveds. After the initial short climb, Maxwell is 15 seconds back, with the larger chase group 22 seconds behind the leader. 9:30 PDT: Chasing Group 25 Seconds Behind Rissveds The gap keeps growing to Jenny Rissveds as her early attack is proving brutal as no rider has an answer for her speed yet. 9:34 PDT: Rissveds Starts Lap 6 with a Lead of 34 Seconds Jenny Rissveds starts the sixth lap with an advantage of 34 seconds against the three-rider chase group of Samara Maxwell, Loana Lecomte and Jennifer Jackson. 9:36 PDT: A Group of 14 Now Chase Rissveds The start of the sixth lap has seen the first two chase groups come together, creating a huge pack of 14 riders working to close in on Jenny Rissveds. With a gap of around 30 seconds, if these riders work together, this could be closed. 9:40 PDT: A Mistake from Lecomte Loana Lecomte makes a mistake through the monster roots as she stalls, causing problems for Samara Maxwell as well. 2nd-placed Tamara Wiedmann now holds a small lead over the rest of the chase group. 9:43 PDT: Rissveds' Lead Shrinks to 27 Seconds Tamara Wiedmann is doing the hard work of closing in on Jenny Rissveds as the gap closes to 27 seconds. Loana Lecomte in third is 31 seconds back. 9:46 PDT: Maxwell Back in 2nd Samara Maxwell has returned to second place as the lead grows again to Jenny Rissveds on the main climb of lap seven. 9:50 PDT: Maxwell Breaks Away from the Chase Group Samara Maxwell has now broken away from Tamara Wiedmann and Jennifer Jackson, as she is now 42 seconds back from Jenny Rissveds. 9:53 PDT: With 2 Laps Remaining, Rissveds Leads by 36 Seconds Samara Maxwell, Tamara Wiedmann and Jennifer Jackson managed to pull back a few seconds on Jenny Rissveds in the second half of lap seven. Unless they can do some damage on the main climb, it is unlikely they will make up a significant amount of time. 9:58 PDT: Jackson & Maxwell Break Away from Wiedmann Samara Maxwell and Jennifer Jackson are now in their own group with a 40-second gap to Jenny Rissveds. Tamara Wiedmann has dropped back by another ten seconds as she is close to fourth-placed Evie Richards. 10:02 PDT: Rissveds Begins the Final Lap 38 Seconds Ahead Jenny Rissveds is looking unstoppable as with one lap left, she is ahead by 38 seconds. 10:04 PDT: A 4-Rider Group Battle for the Remaining Podium Spots With it unlikely the gap can be closed to Jenny Rissveds, there is a big battle looming for the remaining two podium spots. At the start of the final lap, Samara Maxwell, Tamara Wiedmann, Jennifer Jackson and Evie Richards are all in the mix for a podium finish. 10:08 PDT: Maxwell & Jackson Pull Away from Richards & Wiedmann Samara Maxwell and Jennifer Jackson have ridden away from Evie Richards and Tamara Wiedmann on the main climb of the final lap. The gaps are pretty small, so we could still be in for a big sprint finish for the podium. 10:10 PDT: Maxwell Gaps the Chasers Samara Maxwell has found some strength in the closing stages of the race, creating a nine-second gap to third-placed Jennifer Jackson. 10:12 PDT: Rissveds Wins in Brazil Jenny Rissveds completes a huge effort as she rode away on lap four and never looked back before crossing the finish line after nine laps of racing. The Elite Men's Race as it Happened: 10:45 PDT: The Elite Men are Off The final race of the weekend is here as Christopher Blevins is first onto the course. 10:48 PDT: The Specialized Team Goes Straight to the Front In a repeat of last weekend, both Christopher Blevins and Victor Koretzky are straight to the front. Following Blevins and Koretzky is another Specialized rider, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann. 10:53 PDT: Vidaurre Kossmann Leads into Lap 2 Martin Vidaurre Kossmann fronts the lead group as four Specialized team riders are in the top five. 10:57 PDT: A Mistake from Colombo Filippo Colombo gets caught out in the flat turn before the monster roots, losing a lot of places as he is tangled in the course tape. 11:00 PDT: Specialized 1-2-3 Still at the Front The Specialized team remains in control of the race on lap two as Adrien Boichis leads before Martin Vidaurre Kossmann and Victor Koretzky. XCC winner Christopher Blevins sits in sixth. 11:01 PDT: A Group of 9 Starts Lap 3 Christopher Blevins leads a group of nine onto the third lap. The chase group, headed by Luca Braidot, is around 14 seconds back. 11:07 PDT: Schurter Down to 23rd Nino Schurter is not having the start he would have wanted to today's racing with a gap of 28 seconds to the race leaders. 11:10 PDT: A Group of 10 Riders  at the Front After Lap 3 The third lap saw one more rider added to the leading group of riders, with ten racers sitting at the front. 11:13 PDT: Blevins, Koretzky & Boichis Create a Small Lead The three Specialized team riders, Christopher Blevins, Victor Koretzky and Adrien Boichis, have opened up a small lead of three seconds. 11:16 PDT: Avondetto & Vidaurre Kossmann Join the Leaders Simone Avondetto is the only non-Specialized team rider in the five riders leading the race as a gap of three seconds opens to the chase group led by Filippo Colombo. 11:18 PDT: A Group of 8 Back at the Front for the End of Lap 4 After breaking away, the top five racers were caught by Filippo Colombo, Luca Schwarzbauer and Luke Moir at the end of lap four. 11:27 PDT: No Change to the Leading Group After Lap 5 The fifth lap saw no real changes at the front of the race as the same eight riders remained in the lead group. With five laps to go, there is still a lot of the race left for riders to make a winning attack. 11:29 PDT: Cullell Estape & Püntener Join the Leaders Jofre Cullell Estape and Fabio Püntener have joined the leaders to make a group of ten riders as the race seems to be coming back together. 11:33 PDT: Blevins, Vidaurre Kossmann, Avondetto & Koretzky Break Away Christopher Blevins, Martin Vidaurre Kossmann, Simone Avondetto and Victor Koretzky have created a gap of 11 seconds to the chasing group led by Luke Moir. 11:34 PDT: The Leading 4 Racers are Ahead by 15 Seconds Going into Lap 7 The lead group, filled with three Specialized team riders, has started the seventh lap with a gap of 15 seconds to the chase group. 11:36 PDT: Adrien Boichis Closing the Gap to the Leading Racers Adrien Boichis has nearly closed the gap to the leaders as he has pulled the chaser back to the front of the race. The gap quickly closed from 15 to four seconds at the start of the main climb on lap seven. 11:39 PDT: Avondetto Attacks Creating a 7-Second Gap to 4th Simone Avondetto launches a big attack with only Christopher Blevins and Martin Vidaurre Kossman following. Victor Koretzky is now leading the chase group seven seconds back. 11:41 PDT: Koretzky & Boichis Close the Gap Victor Koretzky and Adrien Boichis have caught the leaders bringing four Specialized team riders into the leading five racers. 11:43 PDT: Püntener Takes the Lead Fabio Püntener has taken the lead through the start/finish area as there are now 10 riders at the front. The Specialized team has so far not been able to dominate as they did during round one. 11:51 PDT: Püntener Attacks Through the Feed Zone to Create an 8-Second Gap Fabio Püntener starts lap nine with an eight-second lead after missing the tech feed zone at the end of lap eight. 11:54 PDT: Vidaurre Kossmann Catches Püntener Martin Vidaurre Kossmann has caught Fabio Püntener and created a three-second lead as the attacks begin with less than two laps remaining. 11:56 PDT: It's a Specialized 1-2-3 at the Front Again Team Specialized are back in 1st, 2nd and 3rd as Martin Vidaurre Kossmann leads before Christopher Blevins and Adrien Boichis. 12:00 PDT: Püntener Attacks Again Through the Feed Zone to Create an 4-Second Gap Fabio Püntener starts the final lap in the lead after missing another trip through the tech feed zone. We are in for an incredible final lap. 12:01 PDT: Specialized 1-2-3-4 After the First Climb on Lap 10 The Specialized team is in formation as they hold the leading four positions into the final time up the main climb. 12:03 PDT: Boichis, Blevins & Vidaurre Kossmann Lead by 6 Seconds Adrien Boichis, Christopher Blevins & Martin Vidaurre Kossmann lead as they reach the top of the main climb. Simone Avondetto is sitting in fourth place as the top-ranked rider not on the Specialized team. 12:08 PDT: Christopher Blevins Achieves a Perfect Weekend In an all-out sprint for the win, Christopher Blevins leads a podium sweep for the Specialized team.

        "content": "Starling Releases Brazed Steel Clutch Stem: PRESS RELEASE: STARLING CYCLES Introducing the Starling Cycles Clutch Stem . It’s a tough, timeless and beautiful way to clutch your bars tight and set you apart from the clones. Handmade in Taiwan, the Clutch is a brazed steel stem that’s built strong. It’s made to last, and finished in Bristol with powder coat colour options to match any Starling frame, including legacy colours and that lesser-spotted Raw IPA finish. This isn’t a stem for weight weenies or marginal gainers. There’s no CNC wannabe-wizardry. No shaved grams. No Robocops or Johnny Fives. It’s made by a bloke in a workshop with his hands. It’s tough, it’s simple, it looks totally different to anything aluminum, it’ll clamp your bars tight for decades. It even has a pair of beautiful, understated and stainless Starlings on the faceplate as a subtle nod to the brand. And we're making just 50 of them in this first batch. Available on a first come, first served basis. How tough is it? The Clutch is rated for enduro use. Get it clamped on and go hammer and tongs, no bother. How much does it weigh? Who cares. Compared to a CNC stem, it adds fewer grams than that squashed banana you’ve got strapped to your frame. How stiff is it? 43% MOAR STIFFER. Just kidding. We’ve got no idea. It feels great though. Don’t overthink it. Why build a stem? “Because no one else was making one that quite fits the Starling style,” says our founder Joe McEwan. “Everything else out there is built to meet marketing specs or chasing pointless weight savings.

        "content": "Shimano’s Trail Born Fund is Pushing MTB Projects Forward Worldwide - Sea Otter 2025: Shimano’s booth at Sea Otter was sadly devoid of new products, but behind the bikes and drivetrains on display was something more grounded: the Trail Born Fund—a bold, long-term initiative aimed at putting more legal, sustainable, rideable trails on the map. Announced in August 2024, Trail Born is Shimano’s 10-year, $10 million commitment to global trail development. Its core mission is about completing actual dirt projects, whether that means building new trails, revitalizing classics, or creating public riding spaces like pump tracks and skills parks. What It’s All About Trail Born is about momentum—the moment when a great trail idea becomes a real trail on the ground. Shimano is focusing its efforts on projects that are poised to move into the building phase: the ones where the maps are drawn, the approvals are lined up, and the community is behind it, but the machines haven’t started rolling just yet. It’s designed to unlock that crucial next step for communities. Though it’s a global initiative, Trail Born is built to work on a regional scale, with tailored application processes set to roll out soon. The focus is on projects that are not only build-ready but also rooted in the communities they’ll serve, designed with sustainable access in mind, and capable of telling a story that inspires more people to ride. The biggest thing for us is the story. How is this trail going to give back to the communities?  It's really interesting for us. We want to learn about the area and help it grow.  Hopefully, Trail Born can help move it to the next level. — Scott Jewett, Shimano Trail Born What They’ve Been Up To Already, the program has helped bring dirt to shovel on some standout builds around the world. In California, it backed the Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship to move the Mt. Hough Trails into the next phase of development. In South Africa, the team at Helderberg Trails leaned on Trail Born to bring NEEDles for Speed to life outside Cape Town. Over in San Clemente, California, a new community pumptrack got rolling thanks to support for the OCMBA. And in Tasmania, the Blue Derby Trails network just got a little bigger with the addition of Triple 3, a new line shaped to keep things fast and loose. They’re carefully selected builds designed for long-term access, community connection, and the kind of stories that can shift the culture around trail building. What’s Coming Next This summer, Shimano is launching a dedicated Trail Born website on which riders, advocates, and nonprofits can find the full breakdown of funding criteria, deadlines, and success stories. Shimano is also building a media effort around the program, sharing the stories behind each dig to inspire riders and raise the profile of grassroots trail builders worldwide. How You Can Get In On It If you have a build-ready trail project—or know someone who does—you can apply right now by emailing TrailBorn@Shimano.com. Applications are reviewed annually, with a winter intake and funding decisions announced each spring, just in time to put tools to work. For now, the process is North America-centric, but regional programs are in the works and expected to launch by 2026. In a week like Sea Otter, where shiny new bikes and flashy tech tend to steal the spotlight, it’s cool to see some of the focus go toward something a little more grounded. Programs like Trail Born don’t just hype the ride; they help build the places we ride, one community at a time."

        "content": "Burning Question: 16 Brands Share How Tariffs Will Affect The MTB Industry - Sea Otter 2025: Sea Otter might be a paradise of polished prototypes and anodizing, but behind the sparkle and carbon lay a quieter, more complicated conversation. As riders drooled over fresh gear and brands unveiled their latest technological achievements, there was a noticeable undercurrent of uncertainty—namely, the looming impact of tariffs. We heard it straight from the source: brands big and small are facing tough questions with no easy answers. Will that new product actually launch this summer? How much will it cost by the time it hits shop floors? In most cases, even the people making the products don’t know for sure. To get the full picture, we tracked down a mix of American manufacturers and Asian importers to hear how things are shaking out from both ends of the supply chain. Most were unsure, all were adapting, and no one seemed certain what the next few months would bring, especially with how quickly things are changing. So we asked the one question everyone’s quietly worrying about: “How are tariffs affecting your business—and what impacts can consumers expect to see?” Here’s what they told us. Thule Ariana Stow, Communications Manager, North America How are tariffs affecting your business, and what impacts can consumers expect to see? About 75% of our rack products sold in North America are produced in Connecticut.  We make our cargo boxes in Chicago, so there's a lot of domestic manufacturing.  Similar to any brand that's manufacturing the product, for sure, but because we do produce in North America for North America and in Europe for Europe, we are kind of in a unique position, compared to some of the competitors in the space that are obviously manufacturing overseas and importing the products. So we actually have the luxury that when we're developing a new product like this, we get to go to the back of house, like, I'm literally working at my desk. I can walk to the back and see it being put together. And same with our product manager in Connecticut, he can see if there is anything that needs to be addressed; he can see it right there, rather than being many thousands of miles detached from the process. This positions us uniquely compared to competitors in the space. Tennet Tyler Deschaine, Owner How are tariffs affecting your business, and what impacts can consumers expect to see? We actually dual-source, so we have a bit of experience on both sides. We produce some of our products in the US, like our flat pedals and our stems. Some of the stuff out of the US could be affected, as some of our material does come out of Canada. There's a pause on that now. Everything changes every day, which is really frustrating and annoying. As of right now, we're just reacting as it hits us. I did have product land yesterday, so I don't know if it'll be affected in any way. I haven't gotten the bill for duty yet. So we'll see what the bill is on there. Where from? Taiwan. So it's 32% on stuff from Taiwan.  That's what it was, and now it's back to what it usually was with the pause. But even our US stuff is affected; we source our bearings and some seals. Some of the parts that we assemble our American-made pedals are sourced out of Asia. We’ve tried to produce our pedal 100% in the US, and the cost of producing a 100% American-made pedal in the US is significantly higher.  So the machining of the platform is where we can do it, and then a lot of the smaller internal parts, those costs are really high out of the US sources. Maybe that'll change as there's more demand and the industry starts maybe shifting or moving in that direction, those costs come down, but as right now, even if we wanted to do a fully US made flat pedal, it would be more expensive than paying tariffs on the parts to assemble our American made pedal. We're not going to change pricing until we find out at the factory. For our Taiwan-made stuff, like our new wheels, which we brought to market about a month ago. We priced them around what we would pay to import them, and then the duty costs. After that 32% tariff landed on us, we reassessed our pricing, and we would have been losing money. So our margins are tighter on our product like that. We would have had to raise prices. There's just no way around it. If this administration reimplements tariffs at 32% on Taiwan, and they hold, we're gonna have to raise prices. We'll eat as much as we can. As a small company, we produce smaller volumes of product compared to our bigger competitors. As a small business, we're way more affected by that. It hurts us a lot. We don't have a lot of margin to absorb these cost increases. So we have no other choice but to raise prices and try to stay competitive. Do you get terms on the duties or tariffs? Those literally get a bill as soon as they land. It depends on how you import them. If you use a freight forwarder, the freight forwarder will often pay for it, and then you'll have to pay them. FedEx sometimes does that with air freighted stuff. The government wants their money now. Absolutely, they're not doing terms. What about international markets that you sell into? We sell in South America, Mexico, and Australia. The biggest thing that affects us there is not tariffs, because those are between those two countries, Taiwan, and we don't sell a lot of our American-made products in those markets, because it's just too highly priced.  Taiwan sourced stuff to Australia, for example, it's the value of the dollar. So the shift in the dollar amount between the two countries and the US dollar, their dollar getting the hit, is definitely affecting us too. I had our distributor in Australia essentially say, ‘Hey, I really want to bring this stuff in, but as of right now, we can't until the dollar is stronger. ’ our international distribution is is a market that we want to grow and it's harder now to do that for sure. Sea Sucker Chuck Casagrande, Owner and Founder How are tariffs affecting your business, and what impacts can consumers expect to see? Since we are in the States, we see both sides of it. It's interesting from our point of view, because we're American-made, which helps us. If China gets tariffs, it allows us some advantages, as all our competitors are getting their stuff in that way.  Most racks come from China. We make them all here. But the problem can come in the international markets that we've developed. So if we fight with Europe, Europe's our friend, and we give them a tariff, they give the tariff back, China's sitting in the corner, China's my biggest competitor on racks in Europe. So it would hurt me. If that happens, I may lose. I'm already getting fewer sales in Canada because of it. Besides tariffs, it is how people view us internationally; There are a lot of lists going around with, 'hey, where do I buy? I'm in Germany. I don't wanna buy an American rack. What's the alternative?' With all those lists going around, no one wants to buy American. That's the other issue that we're dealing with that might take a little bit longer. Even if we fix the tariffs, we're gonna have a little bit of blowback because of how we've done all this. Do you guys source all your materials from the States? Everything's here. Well, there are some screws and stuff I've gotten from China. I think there are two or three little tiny parts. We make everything, we have a full machine shop, injection molding, router, we do everything. We do all our own prototyping, all our own engineering, we do everything in-house in Florida. Abbey Bike Tools Jason Quade, Founder and Owner How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what can customers expect? Obviously, it's a little different for you guys who are made in America, right? We have always built our tools in Oregon with US mills and materials, so we don't have any overnight impacts. However, as the tariff situation firms up and we have a full scope of what the rules are gonna be, we expect to see increases in our general cost of doing business. We have all the support products that we have to buy, cutting tools that we import from Europe, and shop things like nitrile gloves. So, even as an American company, there are still some effects. Do you think that will impact customers in the near future, or is it just a matter of waiting to see what happens? We don't have any reason to make rash decisions at this point. I don’t think that what we make is going to get more expensive overnight. There are things that we're definitely keeping an eye on and just trying to run a good business, just like everybody. We might see price increases, maybe late midseason or towards the end of the year, if we're going to see them. But yeah, we’ll see what happens. FSA Mark Vandermolen, Managing Director FSA USA How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what can customers expect to see? As of this morning, we have a 90-day pause on any incoming tariffs on our current product. We source all our products from Taiwan. So we don't do anything out of China, so we're not impacted by that part of the tariffs.  We're certainly investigating all possible options as to how we would manage in what might come up. We would need to be prepared in case things change tomorrow or next week. But without a doubt, we'll look at this 90-day period as to how we can best mitigate the tariff impact without putting any undue damage across, from the consumer all the way through the supply chain. So we need to be mindful of all points of the supply chain to make sure that we can deliver the best possible value. Yoshimura BIG E. How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what could this mean for customers? Don't do anything knee-jerk. That would be my advice if somebody asked me. For us,  we have minimal products coming in from other countries. That's the one thing we're in the right spot for. We're building stuff in the US. Obviously, the product that I just talked to you about (Coated eeWing cranks) comes from a different country, so that might affect us. However, in general, I think it's a good thing. The analogy I make is: if you don't go to the gym for 40 years, you're gonna hurt the next day. But I think after time, you're gonna it's gonna be better in the long run, so that's kind of my overview, broad brushing. I worked for GT Bicycles back in the 80s and 90s. We made stuff here like crazy back then. And so I'd love to see stuff being made here again personally. So the other stuff is made here, the pedals and stuff? Well, yeah, we make everything in our shop in Chino, California. If we don't make it in our shop, such as anodizing, it's done 10 miles away. We're coming out with a new product that has a mechanism on it. We can't stamp that piece in our shop, so that piece is done 10 miles away. So we want to keep everything as close as possible, not go offshore, and that's kind of just our MO. Shimano Mathew Cipes, Senior Product Manager How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what could this mean for customers? We are currently evaluating the impacts of the tariffs on the costs of our products. We have not made any changes at this time. Nobl Wheels Vic Leeson, Customer Service Manager How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what could this mean for customers? We recently opened up a Bellingham location. It wasn't a knee-jerk reaction. We've been planning on doing that for three or four years. Twelve months ago, it was kind of when we decided, ‘Okay, we've actually got to do this.’ We had occupancy in our location in Bellingham, even before the current government, so we structured it just to kind of mitigate. There are a few different aspects that have been beneficial to why we’re there. Shipping costs have been reduced, and transit paths to Canada and then back to the US. That supply chain makes sense. It’s obviously changing very rapidly, but right now, with the most recent escalations between the US and China, is that going to have a direct effect on you guys and potential customers? Yeah, potentially, it all comes down to money, right? So, it's not something that's currently affecting our costs, but long term, that has to come from somewhere. I would also say that inflation and interest rates have continuously gone up in the last few years, and we haven't adjusted for that for a long time, so that's something to consider as well. It's something that we just have a lot of conversations about, even in general. So, no crazy price hikes or changes immediately? Not immediately. It just changes so quickly, right? Like this time last week? The tariffs were very different. Two days ago, the bomb hit. So now it's like last week. I think it's good not to panic and make a reaction based on knowledge, not just a need. That's why there's a lot of power with us having the location in Bellingham: consumers in the US are kind of safe with the knowledge, and they're buying from a company that's kept in the US, and they won't be affected. But the wheels would still get tariffs at port if they came today? So our company still has that tariff—it's like 110 percent now. It's challenging, but it's all a part of the excitement of running a company, right? Your life would be boring without these things, or we could just ride our bikes—who really knows? We are all the people who didn't grow out of our bikes—we figure it out. I think that it has made us grow a lot very quickly in the last little bit. Forbidden Bike Company Owen Pemberton, CEO How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what will that mean for customers? That's a bit of an open-ended question, isn't it? The tariffs are causing huge disruption. Right now, the biggest difficulty is that if you don't know what you're dealing with, you can't plan for it. So, it's causing a lot of people headaches, not just us, but everyone. I was in Asia recently, and everyone I talked to is in the same position.  Nobody knows which way to go, really. Yeah, it's a big problem. If there are tariffs, things are likely to get more expensive, as they have to. I don't know. The way I look at it now, the best case, I think, is going to be the same as it was. We just don't know exactly. Calgary Cycle Derek Lee, Owner How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what will that mean for customers? Right now, it's just up in the air. Every brand is doing something different. A lot of brands are just waiting because it keeps changing. So right now, if you're buying a bike in Calgary, Alberta, the prices are as good as they've ever been. But going forward, we have no idea, and it's changing daily. We get an email that this and that are happening, and then two days later, we get an email that it's not happening. So some brands are trying to hold their stance and they're pricing through the summer season, our busy season, and other brands are just like me, and I have just no idea what's going on. Have you seen any brands hike up prices on existing inventory? I've heard some brands have price lists coming out where stuff is definitely being jacked, and obviously stuff that's already in the pipeline, so it's a little shady. That's not my favourite. We have some pretty good vendors that we've dealt with for a long time, and I think they're all trying to be reasonable, but there's no doubt that everyone's a bit panicked. It’s interesting.  I feel like it kind of flipped from everyone saying, ‘You gotta get rid of everything we got. We got all these old products.’ Now it's like if you had a bit of a stockpile, you might actually be better off. But then next week, it could be like, ‘Oh my God, I got rid of this. ' It's gonna be interesting.  We're honestly just going to keep plowing forward and keep doing what we do, and I don't think it's going to affect the Canadian bike season too much this year, but this time next year could make a big, big difference. Yakima Austin Tucker, Brand Manager How are tariffs affecting your business, and how could that trickle down to customers? I mean, tariffs are always a thing, right? Right now, there are certainly a lot of questions floating around.  Our stance is to take it day by day. We don't really know what's gonna happen. It seems to change daily, so we're watching it. We have had to deal with tariffs in the past, so tariffs are not new to us. We put in place a price change in early April, a super minimal one. That way, there was no disruption to our dealer networks. So that they didn't come in summer months, didn't feel the pressure of not knowing whether or not prices were gonna increase and things like that. The real answer is we're taking it day by day. First Degree Shoes Christian Brandstaetter, CEO How are tariffs affecting your business, and how could that trickle down to customers? It's only been effective for one week, so we don't really know how it will affect us. We still have some stock in the US, so we’ll keep the price for those, but we don't even know how long this import tax will hold. We have stock for this season already in the US, and we hope the tariffs will be reduced for next year. Revel Bikes Matt Boughton, Product Manager How are tariffs affecting your business, and how could that trickle down to customers? You know, first off, we had the fun idea of we're gonna put the tariff jar out. It's like the swear jar, but every time you say tariff in our booth, you put a dollar in it, and we'll buy beer at the end of the week. But I mean, in all seriousness, it's wild because we're learning something new every day, if not hourly, at some points.  I think it's easy to overreact to a lot of it, and there's justification for that. For us, we're really just taking it one day at a time. We're learning something new. It sounds like now we have a 90-day reprieve, at least on the significant tariffs. There's still a blanket 10%. 140%  on China is insane. So it has the potential to be massively disruptive. There's no doubt about that. I think we just have to try to be smart, not overreact too much, and hopefully, we all learn something from COVID when it comes to the reactionary part of things. We can all get through this, so I don't know, I guess stay tuned over the next couple of days, and we'll see what more we continue to learn. So, no immediate knee-jerk reaction. It doesn't sound like it, like price changes in the immediate future? No, a couple of days ago, it was definitely a different story. All right, we have to figure this out. But like I said, within the day-to-day, it's always changed. And so I think at this point, we're kind of back to square one. There's going to be a little bit of extra costs involved, it sounds like, but we're not looking at changing anything for the customer at this point. Coast Optics Sam Grainger Founder How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what does that mean for customers? So it's been a little chaotic and really hard to keep track of it, something that's changing so much. So you almost have to pause and let something settle before making any decisions. We're a small company, so that's just our outlook. We don't have the resources to start making big changes. It was reassuring to chat with some bigger bands who were doing the same thing. The cool silver lining that's come out of it was some anxiety at first of affecting our US sales, and then, the Canadian support has been overwhelming, and we are still getting a lot of support from the US, even though technically, tariffs are now in place for us, which is really cool. Yeah, it's like people still wanting to support. We're quite fortunate that our price point is a fair bit lower than a lot of our competition. That's something that's been important from the start.  So maybe that helps. And you're gonna try to maintain that, I guess, as long as you can? Exactly. Even with these new product launches, we try really hard to keep the price points low. That costs us a fair bit more, but we didn't want to unload that on the customer because everything is so expensive nowadays. But yeah, it's tricky. You kind of just have to wait for something to settle in, and it's really only temporary, I think.  Yeah, it's like a term that is a long time, but we're trying to think of the long game. High Above Packs Kyle Thackray, Owner How are the tariffs affecting your business, and what does that mean for customers? Yeah, I mean, I would say that the first part is we don't know yet, because it changes every day. Being American made we have the advantage that we're not paying tariffs on the full product, but obviously our materials come from around the globe, so it'll affect some of our materials, which ultimately will affect things, we don't know yet, obviously, but if if demand goes up for US manufacturing, generally that also means the price goes up for US manufacturing, like it's it's all connected and,  it's not positive for anyone's business.  We're in a position where, luckily, being made in the US,  it's not affecting us as much and as immediately as some other brands, but it doesn't mean it doesn't affect us here. So you guys don't have any price increases or anything not immediately planned, but in the long term? If there are giant tariffs on everything, everything in the world is going to be more expensive. What about your markets, do you guys mostly sell to the US? That's a great point. It definitely affects our ability to get it distributed into places like Canada. Anytime we have to ship somebody across the border, it's now more expensive for the customer on the other side. And Canadian people are kind of turning to know Americans. I mean, our international traffic has dropped remarkably fast, so it's not helpful. If everything in the world gets more expensive, people have less money to spend, too.  If people stop buying bikes altogether were kind of screwed... Honestly, the constant change is part of the difference, too. Project 321 Mark Wells, Director of Business Development How are the tariffs affecting your business, and how does that affect customers? We're a Canadian manufacturer, and the biggest impact is on anything coming into Canada from the US, which we don't have a lot of. When we're selling into the US, that can impact American customers wanting to buy our parts. As far as I can glean from Trump's speech, anything covered under the US MCA won't be hit with tariffs and our products are covered under the US MCA. So right now, we're not gonna rest on that, because things change day to day, hour by hour, but right now, we're not affected, and our customers in the US, buying our parts, are not affected. But again, there's no guarantee tomorrow. Right now, we're not sweating too hard."

In the women's category, apparently, only bad luck or a high visit from abroad could stop Nežka this year. Two weeks after the season opener in Nova Gorica, the SloEnduro racing crowd gathered in Ilirska Bistrica in South-Western Slovenia, right on the border with Croatia, on the trail system named Črne njive. The participation in the fourth edition of SloEnduro Borovci, organised by GKD Borovci (also local trail builders) was once again large and very international: 260 participants came from ten countries, almost all the fastest from Nova Gorica also turned up. The strongest race ever held in Ilirska Bistrica is one of the biggest sporting events in the Ilirska Bistrica region, where the international hill climb car race reigns supreme. After a wet week, the conditions on the special stages were still slippery during Saturday's practice, but for Sunday's race on the seven stages, including the ‘powerstage’ stage for the e-bike category, the conditions were excellent, with only a few wetter sections to be found. On the long course, 1300 vertical meters of climbing on each of the two days, and almost 18 minutes of ‘net’ racing for the fastest on Sunday. Men's Long Course The best start was made by Slovenian favourite Miha Smrdel (MBK Črni Vrh), SloEnduro champion from 2022 and 2023. Miha won the first special stage but then lost too much in the second and third, so even with a win in the fifth, he could not get back into the fight for the top places, finishing sixth. The initiative was taken by the two fastest riders from Nova Gorica, Hungarian junior Áron Babó (Rad Company Racing Team) and Slovak national champion Luboš Staňo (MTBiker). The latter took the lead with a win in the second stage, then Babó took the lead with wins in the next two, and in the end, he was 2.63 seconds faster than the Slovak in the overall standings. The third-placed Italian junior Simone Leo was 12.3 seconds behind the winner. Two more juniors finished in 4th and 5th, so Staňo was the only elite rider of the top five! Maks Struna and Anže Kofjač from KK Završnica battled it out throughout the race, with Struna finally taking 4th place. For the first time in SloEnduro, the five-man podium was occupied by four juniors. Kofjač, who missed the first round, even missed out on the junior podium, while Smrdel, who finished 6th overall, was also the second fastest elite rider. Women Nežka Libnik (KK Ravne na Koroškem) won five of the six special stages and won by a big margin. Maša Komel (427 Savage Squad), fourth from Nova Gorica, this time challenged Slovak Valentina Grendova (MTBiker), second from Nova Gorica, with two second places on the stages. In the end, Grendova, who won the fifth stage of the day, was still a good two seconds faster, and Maša settled for third place. Neza Štern (MTB club Kranj Scott) was 4th and Damjana Kacafura (MBK Črni Vrh) 5th. What The Winners Said ... This time I didn't mess it up in the first stage like I did in Nova Gorica, so I had more confidence to continue. The first stage didn't suit me so well, but the second stage suited me much better and from there I did great. After the World Cup races, I intend to return to SloEnduro in Mežica. — Áron Babó It was good. I liked the first stage the best because it was the smoothest. It's interesting to hear that it didn't suit Aron. Otherwise, I think that my biggest reserves at the moment, apart from technique, are also in endurance, because I am still a junior. After the World Cup and the SloEnduro Cilenca, I will probably try to do some downhill at my home race in Poseka. — Nežka Libnik In Other Long Course Categories The fastest master was Nejc Huth (Energijateam.com) from the master one category in 9th place overall. The master two category was won by Austrian Walter Zeidler (Do-Biker Bruck) and the master three by Branko Maček (ŠKK Pendalna). In the amateurs category, the victory went to local rider Miha Dovgan (GKD Borovci). In the e-bike category, Jaša Vodopivec won. On Shorter Courses The U17 women's battle of three was won by Italy's Arianna Planischig (UC Caprivesi) ahead of Romania's Irina Marie and Slovenia's Lana Kuzma (KK Črn trn). Men's U17 race had 51 finishers (and four non-finishers). Lenart Sever (KK Črn trn) won again with a 16-second advantage over Hungary's Matyas Csizmazi (Vesc Cycling Team), who won the first of the five stages. Third place went to Aljaž Prosen (Kamplc Racing Team). On the three-stage U15 course, Eva Podvornik (ŠD Grabit) beat Gaja Šuštar (Golovec trails) in the girls' category, while Tjaž Stres (Kamplc Racing Team) repeated his victory from Nova Gorica in the boys' category, followed by Matic Kranjc (KK Črn trn) and Nikolaj Vukojevič (Golovec trails). In the 4Fun category, which was once again large in numbers, the fastest was Milan Czerovszki from Hungary. Lija Leber (427 Savage Squad) was the only girl on the two-stage course for under 13 riders, while Maj Franinovič (Golovec trails) was the best in the boys' category. Results Men 1st.

        "content": "7 Interviews from the iXS Cup: World Cup Racers on Off-Season Changes: 7 Interviews: All Change for World Cup Riders We caught up with seven World Cup riders at the IXS Downhill European Cup in Fort William to hear how they’re adapting to a season of big changes ahead of the World Cup kickoff. Matt Walker Matt, new year, loads of changes for you. How's it been? I’ve literally changed everything this year — but it’s been really cool. It’s the first time in my career I’ve made such a big shift. I’m learning a lot: not just about new parts and the bike, but working with new people and team staff, too. I’d been with Fox suspension for years, and now moving to SRAM, I’m building new relationships with all those guys. Honestly, I think it’s been really good for me. I really like the bike, and I’m building into the season nicely. I’ve done a couple of races already and feel more comfortable every time. It’s going well so far. What's been the hardest thing for you to change? I think the biggest challenge has been moving from a smaller brand to a bigger one like Trek. There’s just so much infrastructure behind the scenes to change and develop the bike. The number of options I now have to get things dialled is huge. The frame is already super adjustable, but Trek can also create custom parts, brackets, linkage changes, different progression — all done in-house. I’ve never had access to that level of customization before. It might sound great on paper, but it’s easy to open a can of worms and get lost in setup tweaks. So I’ve really had to focus on staying grounded, going back to setups that felt good in the off-season, and not drifting too far from them. Even down to bar and stem options — Burgtec offers everything custom, from rise to backsweep and upsweep. But I’ve kept things as standard as possible, just to limit variables. Otherwise, it can get overwhelming. What's been the easiest change? Honestly, the people have made it really easy. That might sound a bit cheesy, but changing environments is always a bit nerve-wracking. I’d worked with the same people at Saracen for a long time and had built really strong relationships. So stepping away was hard. But everyone at Trek has been super welcoming. My new mechanic, Joe, has been a big help. He’s been around the block and worked with top riders, including Reece for the last few years, so he had a solid baseline for the bike setup — at least pressures and that kind of thing. Even back in December and January, it was useful having someone to guide me early on. At one point, I considered bringing my own mechanic, but I think that would’ve made the transition harder. Having someone experienced who already knows the team and the bike has been one of the best parts of the change. We were just saying, you look so good on the bike, so fast. Has it been a conscious thing, or is it just naturally happening that you just seem to be taking to it quite well? It’s just happened naturally, I think. The Saracen bike changed a bit over the years, so I’ve had to adapt before, but those changes were smaller and easier to work through. This new bike is just really easy to ride, which makes a big difference. Even if your suspension setup isn’t quite perfect, you can still ride it well. That’s been a huge help. Even watching footage of myself now, I notice I look different — posture, body position. I ride differently. I don’t know if that’s the frame or the suspension, or just the way I’ve got comfortable on it. Maybe my riding’s adapted to the bike over the off-season. I definitely feel like I’m improving each week and getting more comfortable each race. Coming to places like Fort William helps too — I’ve raced here so many times that I’ve got a solid reference for how things should feel. I was saying to my mechanic that this track makes its speed in different parts compared to the Saracen, so you end up riding the track differently to get the same time. I think that’s why different bikes suit different riders — they fit certain styles better. I’m gelling with this one more and more, and I’m enjoying it. And the more I enjoy it, the faster I seem to go. It definitely looks like it. We're at Fort Bill. Not an ideal day for you. Yeah, not a great day, really. Practice was good — long morning session and I got four runs in, which I was happy with. I felt great on track. But then the rain came in a bit before the final — just some drizzle — and I made a small mistake. I didn’t feel like I did anything major wrong, but I caught the edge of a rock, tucked the front, and went down. Got back up and carried on. I was a bit pissed off at first, knowing I’d thrown away another timed run. After that crash, you get the red mist — unsure if you should cruise it in or push for a time. But at this level, once you’re on the floor, your race is basically done. I just rode it out and crossed the line around eight or nine seconds back. Not terrible, honestly. I’ll take it. There's a strong field here, and with the iXS Cup now acting as a path into World Cups, how different is it from when you started? I think I did two or three iXS Cups back when I was finishing youth and moving into juniors. Even then — and that’s quite a few years ago now — it felt like a great stepping stone. You can really feel that the level here is higher than at a national race. For young riders, it’s a great way to measure yourself, especially for fast British kids who want to see how they stack up against top Europeans. That’s exactly what I did back then. I was racing well in the UK, but I wanted to test myself at a higher level. The junior field at World Cups now is so competitive — top juniors are posting times that place in the top five of the elites. So if you get the chance to race big tracks against strong international competition, it’s only going to help. Harriet Harnden Hattie, new year, new team, new bike. How is it going? Oh, it's going amazing. Honestly, I'm just excited to get a couple of races under my belt and get a feel for it. We've had three team camps, so we've got a good gauge of each other, and there's a great vibe in the team. The bike is honestly amazing. I've never been so comfortable on a bike. It's all going really great. A slight change of discipline here - is there more of a focus this year on downhill? So I'll do all the downhill World Cups and World Champs this year. I'm focusing on that. I'm excited to have a new challenge. I think it'll be great. Kind of pushing myself in different ways. I think I've got great people around me to help me get the most out of myself. I'm excited to see what happens, and I hope everyone else is excited as well. Are you still going to sneak out for some enduros? Yeah, I'm going to be in Finale for the first one because it's before the downhill stuff starts, just to say hello and goodbye sort of thing. But I will also go to the Enduro World Championships in Switzerland, so that would be really cool. I'm obviously still chasing that jersey, but fingers crossed, I can maybe get that. That would be really cool. With all your changes, what's been the easiest one to deal with? Ooh, that's a great question. I think the new team. The environment and obviously a couple of the people are the same, like Reece has come from Trek as well, so we've been together for five years. And then Fraser, one of the mechanics as well, and my agent, he stayed the same. All of that has made the transition easier, and everyone else on the team is just so welcoming; we just gel so well. Honestly, all of them say it feels like we've been teammates for years. It's honestly been the easiest transition you could imagine, which is really, really lovely. It's like a big family, very disjointed, but a great family, and we all balance each other out. So it's perfect. What's been the hardest thing for you to change? I think the change of discipline. When I'm changing discipline, I'm starting again. You're always learning. I'm lucky to have great people to learn from, like Monica, Reece and Henry, who have done it for a while. Even things like the warm up, the practice routine, all of it, you are learning again and I am learning as much as Heather and Stan, the junior riders. Although it's great fun and I'm having a great time, there is still a lot of learning to do. If things don't go amazingly straight away, it's because I am still learning, and I'm not going to get frustrated about that. I know that's just how it goes, and it'll come with time. I've just got to go through the steps a few times to figure out what works for me. Just give it my best. But I haven't seen a timesheet. We think maybe it could be a good result for you in seeding. Dare you dream of some podiums this year? Oh, definitely. That's my dream. I podiumed in Mont-Sainte-Anne at one of the downhill World Cups a couple of years ago, in fifth place. But now you've got to be in the top three to get on that podium. So I like to think I'm putting myself in the best opportunity I can at this time. I've worked hard over the winter. I'm on a great bike. I'm with a great team. There's a great vibe, and I feel like I'm riding better than I ever have. So honestly, I'm not going to rule it out. And you know, you've got to dream big, you've got to aim high, shoot for the stars, isn't it? So, you know, fingers crossed. We're at the IXS. This is now going to be the pathway for European riders to get into the World Cup. How is it riding the IXS? Do you enjoy it? I've really enjoyed it. I mean, it's my first one, actually. I think I'm going to have a lot of firsts this year. It's been really, really great, super well organized. It's been really easy to just kind of go through your steps, and just like any other race, it's just been great. I've just kind of been bobbling along all weekend, having a great time doing laps, riding with the guys. All the Marshalls and organizers and everything have been great, so I'm just enjoying myself. Veronika Widmann Lots of changes for you this year. New team, new bike. Quite a lot of new components. How are you finding it? To be honest, I'm living the dream. It was so last minute that I was thinking I'm not going to race this year, or I might race with some kind of privateer struggles.  Then, last minute, we contacted Jorge, and he was keen, and I literally signed the contract like two days before the deadline for the UCI. Pretty stoked. A big step up, really, as nice as your GT Continental team was last year. This is a full factory team. How has that been? Has it been easy to make that change? Well, technically, I'm on the development team, but the support and products are the same, and it's amazing, really. I'm back on Fox, back on Maxxis. The bike is amazing. Everything is pretty much as great as it can get. I'm just really happy. I've been on the bike since the end of January or the start of February and am feeling good. There are still a few things to change and work out, but it feels pretty good. What's been the hardest thing to change? There are so many changes. For example, people have been asking me how the E13 hub feels, and I couldn't tell you. Of course, you can feel it, but I haven't ridden a bike without. It's tough to tell what is better because everything is just different. It's like a fresh start, so it's not too bad. What's been the easiest? The easiest, I think, was just the relief that I was able to race this year. I just went on the bike, and it just felt like I'm still able to do this. I'm so happy, and everything is just good. All the worries just disappear. That was the easiest, for sure. How did you get on today? It was not so great. It started raining just right before the last woman went down, so the track was a bit surprising. It was quite slippery. Usually, Fort William is good, but the first few minutes were not that great. It was a pretty average run, and I had a few not-so-good sections, but it's okay. I hope tomorrow is still going to be on, and then I can try again. Obviously, you're on the development side of stuff with Mondraker, and this is now the pathway for people to make it to the World Cup? I mean, I've also been in Portugal, and I have to say it's pretty good. Of course, in Portugal, there are so many people, I think it was almost too many people because they couldn't move the logistics, with the shuttles and everything, it was difficult. But it has been way better here, and they have a new timing system with the chip, so they have 2 or 3 splits in the track. So they have good tracks, like also the track in Porto, it was pretty good, and here it's like a World Cup track. So I think it's a pretty good setup, and they're doing a good job. Charlie Hatton Charlie, there's been a fair bit of change for you this year. The bike's very different. How's it been? To be fair, it's been a really interesting process. I've always been quite keen on just getting the bike good and running it. But this year, I've had a totally new opportunity. I literally developed the bike from pretty much the ground up. It's just been really interesting. I think I've learned so much as a rider and so much more about how I want the bike to be, which, for me, has been great. There are big changes in the team, too, right? You're pretty much the only rider left. Everyone else has changed around you. How's that been? It's been very different, obviously not having Kolbe on the team, but I just met up with the new guys. This is the first proper race we've all been at together. Rode with Luke in New Zealand in the winter. It's been really cool, to be fair. Young guys, they're chomping at the bit, so it's really, really good to see. Yeah. The old boy of the team now, mate. I know it's mental. I think I'm still the young guy, but I'm not. Yeah, we're all going that way. I can't believe it's Mad. What's been the easiest thing to change? To be honest, the belt and the gearbox. I was very dubious about it to start with and the first day I rode it, I was like, Holy shit, this is really good. It does work really, really well. I'm very stoked on it, so that's cool. What's been the hardest bit about that changeover? The hardest bit for me has probably been the scope of what we can try. Then, going, I don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but I also want to try a lot of things. It's very hard to get that balance between trying things for the sake of it and sort of not going down the rabbit hole. So it's quite a hard thing, but I think we've got the bike in a very good place for the amount of time we've had it. It's always going to be continually changing and developing. Good result for you in the qualifier today. You didn't really enjoy the run. How did you find it up there? Well, time and everything were good, but I just really struggled to get in a flow. I spoke to a lot of people and they said the same. I was riding down thinking, right, Charlie, come on, mate, you need to crack on now because you're going to be 20s back. But come down, and I was four and a bit seconds up, so it was obviously a good run, but I didn't feel the best. But Fort William this year is probably the toughest I've ever seen it. I think a lot of people have said the same. It's definitely not an easy place. We're at the iXS and this is now the route for kids into the World Cup, right? How have you found racing at the iXS? It's very different from when you started, probably. Yeah. I've not done loads of the iXS races. I've done probably a few in my time. But it's really good. It's ran really well and even the queues today have been pretty small. So obviously they've got World Cup level tracks.Good timing system, good marshals. It's gone real smooth. I'll definitely be doing some more. Ready to go for the start of the season? Yeah, really excited. I guess we've only got a couple of weeks now, so it's come around so fast. At the start of the off-season, you think you've got loads of time, but it creeps up on you. I'm really keen to get started. Adam Brayton Ad, a fair bit of change for you this year as well. Different bike. How's it all been? Big changes, but it's been really good. I'm absolutely buzzing with the Saracen. Obviously Matt and Greg proved the bike, so that was the main thing for me. I knew I was getting on a bike that was really good, so it's good for the head. I've been enjoying riding it, enjoying learning the new bike and set up on that. Just need to do it justice now. What's been the easiest thing about that change? The bike just works really well. The linkage is super active. I feel it's such an underrated bike, but I think we will definitely see a lot more of them this year. Toughest thing? There isn't any, to be honest. I don't do that, mate. I don't do that. The biggest change for you, I guess, this year is your access to riding World Cups. How are you feeling? I mean, are you going to do some stuff under a BC jersey? Yeah, I applied for the jersey and I got into Val di Sole, and that is it. It's not a bad place to be racing, and the Ice cream's good too. Ice cream is good, pizza is cheap, croissants are cheap, and coffee is cheap. I mean, what's not to love? Everyone asks, \"Why are you doing Val di Sole?\" It's absolutely horrific. But I personally quite like it, and there are some good rivers nearby with some nice trout. So I guess you're going to be doing a few more iXS/this European kind of feeder series? Honestly, no, I was only planning on doing these two. I'm just going to stick to domestic stuff and racing at home. Potentially, I would like to do Crankworx Whistler. Those events look good, and I've not done it for a long time, and obviously, it's freed up the budget a little bit. So it'd be nice to go and do that and race Garbo and stuff. Hardline, will you be back again this year? Yeah, let's hope so. I was sad to not be Tasmania, it looked a great event but fingers crossed for Wales. Again it would be really nice to do well. Obviously a favourite for me, so yeah fingers crossed we're in for that one. We're at the iXS. This is now the pathway really for kids and people into the World Cup. A bit different from when you started. How do you feel that changes? Do you think it's going to work? Well, first of all, the event is good, right? Yeah. It's great, but yeah, I feel for the younger riders. We had it easy now, looking back. I reckon it will be tough for anyone to break through. Everyone's in the same boat. You'll just have to get your head down, work hard, and get stuck in. I mean, the opportunities are there, but for sure, there are fewer of them, and it is going to be tough. Danny Hart Danny loads a change for you this year again. New team, new bike. How's it been? Yeah, it's been good. There's no job too big or small for the team. It's going really well. Greg's on the phone all the time helping me out with bike setup. I'm here with the team manager and my coach, Alan Miller and my mechanic, Ollie and then Lena, because we're the only Europe-based part of the team. It's going really well. I've been doing a couple of little events leading up to this, and the pace hasn't really been there. But now we're here on a good, proper track. It's pretty savage up there at the minute. Probably the worst I've ever seen it. The speed is there. So I'm quite happy about that because it's been tricky. What's been the hardest bit of the change? For me with this, there's been nothing hard because last year we did it on a shoestring budget with Mark at GT. This right now, I don't even know what the budget is. There's no stone left unturned. We're in New Zealand, we're in Portugal. We're all over. We're here. This is probably the most professional outfit that I've been on. Wow. That's a big statement. Yeah, I know, and I've been around a little bit too. A bit of a change of role for you. You're the most senior man on the team. Are you enjoying that? Yeah, but to be honest, I have been for the past few years. All of my professional career, I've always been the hunted on the team. The young guys are coming up and always chasing me. And what's been good with this team so far is that we were in Portugal a couple of weeks ago, and it didn't go very well by all accounts. Like when you look on paper, and not once did the team, Greg, the team director or my team manager, Alan, say to me come on, like, figure your shit out. It wasn't that. I'm always my harshest critic anyway because, without sounding big-headed, from a young age, I've always been quite successful. So when you win a lot and then you don't anymore, you're always really hard on yourself when you don't. Other teams have been like that in the background as well. Not last year because last year was unique, but this year so far, obviously, it's early doors, but we will get there. It's never just like on me so far. Greg's always trying to improve my bike and helping me with potential technique things. That's good to hear. A great finish to the season last year, so more of the same again in Poland? Poland wasn't the best place for me at the start of the year, but we were all over the place with setup and whatnot. So hopefully, we'll get off on a good foot and have a good race here. Hopefully, tomorrow goes ahead, but the weather's not looking great. But I want to get going and put my best foot forward. We're at the iXS at Fort William? All right, result. How did you feel about your second place in qualifying today? It's good. It's been tricky because the track's so hammered, so it's hard. I know what it feels like to ride this track, but I don't necessarily know what it feels like to ride it as hammered as it is. So it's been a bit of a head game as well. It was good to put that run in, and I was happy with that. Now this is the pathway for younger riders to make their way to the World Cup. A bit different from when you started. How do you feel about the events, because you've been at both, are they good events? When I was coming through, we used to race Maxxis cups in Portugal and Spain, and the iXS wasn't even a thing back then. They're doing a good job. They've run a good series from what I can tell. I've done a few over the years, but what's strange is here in Fort William, I was thinking they'll probably not be that many foreign guys here and it'll just be like a national with a few foreigners. But it's the total opposite. It's like the European Cup, and there are a few English guys. It's quite nice to see because I think they jumped at the opportunity to come here and ride. Obviously, they ride pretty much the same tracks every year with the iXS, I think, and all within, let's say, 8 to 10 hours of each track. Whereas this is like a pilgrimage to Scotland. I was in Dyfi last weekend and it was really nice to see, there were a few guys there and they must have seen that on the computer. They must see it online and think that'll be good to go and ride that, and then coming here has given them that opportunity. Reece Wilson Reece, all change this year. How's it been? It's been a whirlwind of emotions. I'd say completely positive. Today's a pretty good example of that. Just standing, looking at the team and how well we've done across all categories, how consistent everybody is, how consistent the bike feels at every track we go to. There's just never-ending positivity and positive notes to take from everything. I'm glad I've done it, I am. I'm standing here in a great position and very glad that I took a chance on myself, and all of those companies and brands have taken a chance on us and are looking forward to showing what we can do. What's been the easiest thing about the change? The easiest thing has been the people, the group of people that we've put together. If you ask any single one of us, even behind closed doors in a quiet space, we'll all tell you the truth. And we feel like we've been together for ten years. The vibe, the energy, and how relaxed it is, it doesn't even feel like we're racing bikes anymore. It just feels like we're turning up at these places to have fun. That's how it should be, and what a difference that makes. So that's been the easiest part, the transition into a whole new group of people that feels like a family. Has there been anything that's been pretty tough? You're the boss sort of now, so that's a bit scary. I mean, just the negativity in the industry, I'd say, has been the toughest part. For us, to do what we've done from basically nothing in a time where everybody was saying, everything's really bad, and we're all swimming upstream, and it's a struggle. I'd like to think that we've proven that that's not the case, and it is just a mindset that everybody's maybe stuck in over the last year or two. So that's been rough because from our point of view, it's all been positive. There's been loads of positivity and loads of good things. From this weekend, I think that shows that the sport's in a great place. The competition is amazing. The junior categories are absolutely stacked. That's been frustrating, the amount of negativity that the whole sport's been receiving and being posted on the internet, I don't think we need any of that. That's been the toughest part. But honestly, from my standpoint, there hasn't really been anything. It's been hard work, long hours and long days for everybody, but it's paying off. I know you're a big convert to the gearbox. That's a big change, right? How do you find it? Again, honestly, nothing but positive stuff. We've had no issues whatsoever. That's us done. I think I've done six days at Fort William now and over 30 runs and have not done a single spoke, have no flat tires. We've not had a single drivetrain issue. It's literally come down every run. You're ready to go. Yeah, let's go again. And walking around the pits, seeing everybody else, and having the nightmares of wheels and everything else they're having. We have one of the most solid, bombproof setups right now, and that, to go racing with, fills you with confidence. So yeah, it's been mega. Not the day you wanted. How was the qualification for you? Yeah, honestly, I stinking run for me. I actually started right at the top. I've been riding here for like 13 years, and I washed out for the first time in my life, going off the wood onto the island before you rejoin the wood onto the boardwalk. And I mean, lost it fully, like I thought I was going down, and I was going to end up buried underneath the wood on the other side. Somehow saved it, got my foot off, and was all sorts of shapes, but held it together, and then after that, it kind of caught me off guard. The rest of the track was a really interesting kind of gravelly texture where we thought the rain, this place, it soaks in, and normally it becomes like Velcro. I rode it as if it was going to be wet, and it absolutely wasn't wet. I probably had the wrong tires on; I needed something a bit more bite. So yeah, made a few false calls and overrode the bike in those scenarios and just never got any form of flow. Kind of just crashed and wobbled my way down. If I'm honest with you, it didn't feel good. So, to be five seconds back at Fort William is absolutely nothing. That's a second a minute, which is invisible to the naked eye. We're well in touch, and for me, I always struggle with these races that aren't World Cups. That to me is actually a storming result. So looking forward to having another go. We're at the iXS. This is not new, but the nature of it is now a feeder series into the World Cup. How do you feel about it? It seems like a really good vibe, right? Yeah, absolutely. I've loved it. I guess we're calling it the iXS Continental series. So there's a stacked field here for elite males and elite females, obviously got Nina Hoffman, and we've got Hattie. There are a few strong contenders. The junior categories are always stacked, and they're always packed. So I think it's just the fact that there's a race at Fort William. Everybody is buzzed because there's no World Cup there this year. So it's perfect. It's been good. I'm loving it. It's a great event. It's run flawlessly so far. Track's mega. The place looks good right now. The finish line looks professional and clean, and it's like you say, a relaxed vibe. It's a great race. I'm happy to be here."

        "content": "A Brief History Of Upside-Down Forks: A Bumpy Road: In the world of mountain bike suspension, inverted or “upside-down” forks have always been the outliers. With the inner stanchions below and the outer legs on top, they promise better lubrication thanks to gravity pulling oil towards the seals, lower unsprung mass further improving sensitivity, and improved fore-aft stiffness thanks to those thicker legs where they're needed most. Despite all this, and being the default for high-end motorcycles, they’ve remained a curiosity for push bikes. But that's not for lack of trying. Here's a look back at some of the most iconic upside-down forks in MTB history — the good, the bad, and the noodly. Halson Inversion (c. 1994-1995): The OG Travel: 2.5 inches Weight: 3.3 lb / 1.5 kg Notable for: being the one of the first USD forks for bicycles and the last to work with rim brakes. The horseshoe brake brace was connected to outer sleeves, which connected in turn to the lower stanchions, allowing the brakes to move up and down with the wheel. The fork boots covered this join, making it look almost like a conventional fork. It also had a pneumatic damping system, forcing air through small ports to control compression and rebound. This was combined with linear elastomer springs and compressed air to resist bottom-out. Sources: Halson commercial Mountain Bike Action review Exploded view Yo Eddy Blog Marzocchi RAC (1999): Way ahead of its time Travel: 80-120 mm Weight: Unknown Notable for: Being one of the first carbon components (let alone forks) for MTB. Marzocchi wanted to make something lighter than their legendary coil-sprung Z1 and Z2 forks for cross-country. The RAC (Reverse Advanced Composite) had a one-piece carbon upper, combined with a 20 mm magnesium axle and 30 mm stanchions. It offered 80-120 mm travel with coil or air springs and open-bath damping. The idea was to keep the legendary smoothness they were known for, but compensate for the weight with exotic materials and an inverted design. Naturally, it was way too expensive for the mass market and likely still heavier than many alternatives. The RS-1 of its day? Sources: Matt Wragg's article Risse Champ (c.2002): A forgotten forerunner Travel: 6-9 inches Weight: Probably lots Notable for: One of the first DH-specific USD forks. It's hard to find much information of this absolute unit, but it was made in the USA and used a proprietary 120 x 20 mm hub. According to one owner, \"This fork will eat up anything in its path!\" Sources: User reviews : Marzocchi Shiver (2000–2005): The Cult Classic Travel: 120 mm (SC), 170-190 mm (DC) Weight: Approximately 4 kg (DC) Notable for: Perhaps the first mass-produced USD fork; an icon ever since The Shiver came in single-crown and dual-crown flavors. The dual-crown version was heavy even by the standards of the day, but the Shiver won many fans for their reported plushness and iconic look. While never exactly common, these were probably the first USD forks that weren't a complete unicorn, having a respectable five-year production run. Sources: Matt Wragg's article Waki Leaks blog Fox's Prototype Inverted DH Fork (2012): never saw action Travel: presumably around 200 mm Weight: unknown Notable for: Fox's last attempt at USD Gee Atherton got the bike nerds excited with a practice run at the US Open with this monstrous fork in 2011. But despite huge 48 mm upper legs and Fox trying various axle setups (according to some rumors either oversized or solid steel axles), Fox said the prototype wasn't stiff enough for the top racers, and was reportedly heavier than the Fox 40. The project was scrapped without seeing a race run. Sources: Throwback Thursday DVO Emerald Inverted (from 2013): The Wallflower Travel:  203 mm Weight: 3490 grams (actual) Notable for: Bold looks and a carbon arch The Emerald is arguably the spiritual successor to the Shiver DC, with its open bath damping, robust weight and in-your-face aesthetics. Its innovation party piece was the Carbon Torsion Arch (CTA), which could be thought of as an extension of the stanchion guards that went up and over the wheel to add twisting stiffness to the chassis. The 300 g CTA was removable, but stiffness wasn't a strong suit of the fork, even with it installed. Sources: Kazimer's review RockShox RS-1 (2015–2018 ): The comeback that wasn’t Travel:  80/100/120mm Weight: 1,666 g / 3.67 lb Notable for: Combining impressive engineering with lackluster performance RockShox threw a lot of R&D effort into this fork. With one-piece carbon upper tubes and steerer unit, plus a proprietary \"Predictive Steering\" interface with oversized Torque Cap hub on a 15 mm axle, RockShox were proud enough to name it after their first suspension fork. Despite all this, it weighed nearly 100 g more than a comparable RockShox SID of the time, or 330 g more than a modern SID SL. Reviews differed on whether torsional rigidity was an issue, but all agreed there was less steering stiffness than a conventional fork. The proprietary hub and $1,865 asking price were the real sticking points. While it enjoyed some World Cup racing success, few sold. RockShox phased it out and focused their R&D brainpower on improving the lighter, stiffer and cheaper SID. Sources: Mike Levy's review Manitou Dorado (2003–present): Still standing Travel: 180–203 mm Weight: 2970g (2021 Pro model) Notable for: Standing the test of time The Dorado first entered the scene in 2003 and is still on sale today. It's been redesigned and revised several times, but it's always been upside down. Greg Minnaar won his first World Champs title on a Dorado, making it one of the few things besides cockroaches to outlast the GOAT's racing career. The latest Pro model uses 37 mm stanchions, carbon fiber upper legs and a hexagonal axle to boost torsional stiffness. And at under 3 kg, it's within a couple of hundred grams of an Öhlins DH38 or Fox 40. This year, AON Racing, including heavy hitters Harriet Harnden and Reece Wilson, will be competing to win the Gates prize on their Gamux bikes sporting the long-lived fork. Sources: Dan Roberts' 2021 review Mike Levy's 2009 review Bright Racing Shocks F929 Next (2012-present): Travel: 150 mm (designed to match 170 mm forks due to minimal sag) Weight: 2,287-grams (actual) Notable for: Daring to be (very) different The inverted structure of this Italian fork isn't the oddest thing about it. The concept is based around minimal sag (pretty much zero), such that a 150 mm travel fork offers a similar dynamic ride height to a conventional 170 mm fork. When I reviewed it, I found this approach to be a non-starter, as both traction and predictability went out the window, and top-out was a major issue. The fork's torsional stiffness is helped by 49 mm carbon legs, and it relies on RockShox Torque Cap hubs. There is still noticeably more twisting flex than an equivalent conventional fork, but it's perfectly manageable on the trail. Inside, there's a sliding upper bushing, so the bushing overlap increases the further the fork goes into the travel. This could contribute to the sensitivity, which was impressive once into the travel. Sources: Review Intend - various models (2016–Present): Boutique perfectionism Travel: 100–190 mm Weight: 1950g (Hero, 140-170 mm travel) Notable for: Offering several inverted models with competitive weight The boutique German manufacturer has carved out a niche with its high-end, exclusive suspension. Their range includes eight suspension forks: all inverted and all a work of art. While their burliest fork, the Flash, with 160-190mm travel, weighs a claimed 2,350 g (on par with a RockShox Zeb or Fox 38 ), the 140-170 mm travel Hero weighs less than a Fox 36. Their latest and most boutique project, the 3999€ Moto fork adds sliding bushings to the mix. These promise to cut friction in high-load situations by maximising the distance between the bushings as the fork compresses. Sources: Intend Moto First Look Intend Blackline range overview Honorable mentions The above is not an exhaustive list of USD forks; it's simply a selection of highlights we think are most interesting or innovative. Others include the 2017 BOS Obsys , the Showa forks used by the Honda DH team in 2005-2007, the Push Nine.One , EXT Vaia and a myriad of prototypes over the years from almost every suspension brand. What did we miss? Let us know in the comments. Why Haven’t USD Forks Taken Over? Despite their theoretical advantages, USD forks have consistently struggled with torsional and lateral stiffness due to the lack of a brace connecting the legs above the wheel. Manufacturers have tried several approaches to address this, from proprietary hubs to bolt-on arches. Presumably, this issue could be solved with enough material, but most USD forks are already heavier than their conventional counterparts. This could explain why USD is ubiquitous in moto, where extra weight is more acceptable. There is lively debate about whether a lack of torsional stiffness is a bad thing, but riders like what we're used to. Ultimately conventional forks have got pretty damn good thanks to years of R&D, and its hard for the USD forks to turn that around. Perhaps inverted forks with sliding bushings (as seen in a few forks from Bright, Showa, Intend and EXT) could be the technology that gives USD the USP they need to carve out a niche. Fingers crossed the manufacturers of these newest entries don't forget to design effective fenders that aren't complete eyesores..."

        "content": "How Do Pros & Fans Feel About Warner Bros. Discovery’s Organization & Coverage of World Cup Racing in 2025?: Welcome to the 2025 Pinkbike State of the Sport Survey. This anonymous survey is designed to highlight key issues and riders' perspectives on the sport that we, pro riders, and Pinkbike readers all love so much. We surveyed the best riders in the world to hear their thoughts, ideas, concerns, and criticisms on mountain biking in 2025. Now, we're breaking down what we've learned. We're now publishing articles that break down sections of the results, and you'll see the results in full shortly. To read the introduction to the survey click here , and to see all the other currently published SOTS articles click here . Overview For our final State of the Sport article, we are looking at the current opinions of World Cup racers and the Pinkbike community on Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) Sport's organisation and coverage of mountain bike racing. The results in this article are from 118 World Cup racers and over three thousand Pinkbike community members who completed our public survey. Keep scrolling to see some key stats from this year's data. What do World Cup Racers Think About WBD Sports After 2 Years Starting with our responses from World Cup racers when asked if they have confidence in WBD Sport's plans for World Cup racing, 43% of those surveyed had no opinion either way. 16% of the racers surveyed agreed that they felt confident in WBD Sport's racing plans, while 42% did not feel confident. Looking at last year's data, the percentage of survey respondents remaining neutral has remained similar, while those who do not feel confident, have grown slightly. Asked how they would like WBD Sports to improve racing, the most popular choice amongst World Cup racers (chosen by 86% of respondents) was greater prize money. The second most popular choice was more coverage in mainstream media before \"better and more informative coverage.\" It's worth mentioning that while the overall season prize money is paid by WBD Sports, the minimum amounts are set by the UCI and the round-by-round prizes are paid by the local event organising teams. Finally, we wanted to know what the top racers think about the current World Cup coverage from WBD Sports. Of those surveyed, 37% think it is acceptable, with 37% also thinking it is either poor or very poor. 27% of respondents think it is either good or very good. As part of the survey we also asked racers for comments on the race coverage and organisation by WBD Sports. We have included unedited comments from racers below. Rider comments on WBD Sports race organisation and coverage: They are doing a good job, but still a lot of stuff that could be better. I think they forget how important the recruitment of new athletes are. And it's hard to do recruiting if they remove the u23 races and only focus on the big teams. Everyone has to start somewhere, and that's usually in the national team or as a privateer. I know many people who have stopped watching because of the price. The price increase is only going to hurt the viewership Could use the in-race data more. Like timing points. Who was the fastest in the uphill / downhill? Who did the key section the best? They cover only the top 3-5 riders and there is no info (like they have in cyclocross) to show which place anybody is running currently. Warner Bros. is drowning enduro as it is becoming too similar to downhill (DH), which is undermining the unique identity of enduro as a discipline. We need a small recap of the day and then straight into a live feed of the last stage, which should be the hardest one of the day. With the riders being reseeded for the live show. I feel like the organisation is okay, but the coverage of the race is awful. I was told the semi-final was put in to give viewers more coverage, but then they just stopped broadcasting it. Also, the commentating never had any passion compared to when Red Bull and Rob Warner were on. Hard to find and also the commentating isn't great COVER ENDURO. It needs a live show, and also some coverage for juniors It's good, but lacks consistency and creativity at times. Would like better commentating. Need better organisation for how it can be viewed in different regions of the world (eg Oceania especially) Minimal enduro coverage They give up enduro. Solutions exist if they really want to. I'm sad for the discipline, which is fantastic and deserves better. There's been a clear difference since Warner Bros Discovery took over, in every respect. It is too bad there is no U23 XCC coverage as well as many XCO World Cups this year The coverage is good, however the availability was limited, expensive and very difficult to find. Need to do a better job of marketing to non-cycling fans, make it more fun to go to a World Cup. Different commentator It wasn’t very accessible and hard to find. They are charging more and not necessarily giving back to the sport as well. They should include the top 20 riders more in the coverage and not only the top 3... Understaffed They should show more of the race, also riders behind place 5 and don't make it so expensive for the teams and riders, as well as not so complicated with a thousand unnecessary rules! Be more consistent and make sure the schedule is made public well in advance I don't see much difference than during Reb Bull TV. I felt when they broadcast the U23 events it was a real step forward for the whole World Cup and was able to shine a light on future talents and allow spectators to witness their progress from the U23 ranks into the Elites. However, with the news that they are planning on stopping this coverage is a major disappointment, especially for us riders in this category. The quality is there, just the availability. It used to be free, which was really good. Now, only die-hard fans are watching it. Enduro is not been covered properly They did the mistake of not giving free access for the first few years on the website alongside the pay view. Does it really have to be as expensive as they have made it, none of my close friends and family are going to pay to watch it now, which is sad Bring back Rob Warner, show more riders' names in the Live Timing up to 20 or 25 Place see MXGP Or MOTOGP Too much drone footage not enough on the ground Respect for teams and riders is missing; it should be a together not against. Especially, listening to us athletes and teams should be point one and then we find a solution. But at the moment, it’s not like this. Lot of attention on the first, not too much if you’re 5 or 6 They don’t tell the story of the fight for top 5 or top 10 positions. Only the fight for the win which can be boring sometimes. I think it’s worth telling more stories during a broadcast. For example this week 3 Brazilians finished in the top 12 of the XCO World Cup in Araxa and they didn’t highlight it. In my eyes, it’s a huge achievement even when they didn’t win the race. Keep 5 podium/ listen to riders' inputs and ideas The communication is a disaster and they don’t take the riders into consideration Too many promises, vague and changing information. Less media content than before in EWS. They don't inspire confidence. Such poor coverage of the Enduro races. It seems that Warner Bros has no interest in the Enduro discipline. What do Race Fans Think About WBD Sports After 2 Years Moving to our survey of the Pinkbike community, we found that 38% of those surveyed were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the coverage from WBD Sports. Combining those who were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied, it does make up the largest proportion of those who completed the survey at 41% of responses. Breaking the numbers down to just those who told us they paid for access to 2024 coverage, we find a more positive look at WBD Sports' race coverage. 46% were either satisfied or very satisfied with the output from WBD Sports. Only 25% of responses from people who said they paid for access to WBD Sports' coverage were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. Next, we asked who is likely to pay for this year's World Cup coverage. From our responses, the largest group of all respondents (41%) said they were very unlikely, with a further 22% stating outright that they won't pay for this year's World Cup coverage. 26% said they were either likely or very likely to pay. Once again, if we look at the response from only those who said they paid for access in 2024, 69% of respondents were either likely or very likely to pay for this year's race coverage. Only 9% said they weren't going to pay, while 22% said it was unlikely or very unlikely. Lastly, when asked the same questions as the pro racers on whether there is confidence in WBD Sports and its plans for racing, 86% of respondents weren't confident. 18% said they are confident in WBD Sports' plans, which has grown from the 4% who shared confidence in the promoters and broadcasters of World Cups in last year's survey. WBD Sports declined to comment on the State of the Sport data."

        "title": "Review: The CounterSycle Tuned Mass Damper",
        "author": "Jessie-May Morgan",
        "date": "05-13-2025",
        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/review-the-countersycle-tuned-mass-damper.html",
        "content": "Review: The CounterSycle Tuned Mass Damper: A new category of bike component quietly hit the World Cup DH circuit in 2024; the Tuned Mass Damper. While new to mountain bikes, this is not a new technology in general. It is a very well-understood technology that has proved incredibly useful in improving stability in ships, skyscrapers, and even F1 cars. So much so in the latter that the FIA banned the use of TMDs after it became evident that Alonso's Renault was benefitting from a big competitive advantage over cars without one. But, what on earth is it? What is a Tuned Mass Damper? A TMD is a device that reduces vibrations in a structure by counteracting its own resonant frequency. Every structure in existence, from a skyscraper to a human body to a mountain bike, has its own resonant frequency. In skyscrapers, the TMD inside it is tuned to resonate at that same frequency. As the skyscraper oscillates in the aftermath of a large gust of wind, or an earthquake even, the weight inside the TMD moves counter to the skyscraper's direction of sway - out of phase with it - and in doing so, it reduces the maximum amplitude of the sway. CounterSycle Details • Applications: DH & trail riding • Main performance claims: Improves traction and reduces forces that reach the rider • Mounts to the steerer tube (Enduro) • Dimensions: 112mm long, 34mm diameter • Weight: 550g (DH) / 380g (Enduro, tested) • Price: $275 USD (includes choice of bracket) • countershox.com In F1 cars, TMDs were advantageous because they worked to ensure the car was in an aerodynamically favorable position more of the time. As the car's chassis was deflected away from its most aerodynamically favorable position, by acceleration, or a bump on the road for example, the TMD positioned somewhere between the two front wheels was able to bring the nose down earlier, making the car faster. The CounterShox CounterSycle For the avoidance of any doubt, there is no hydraulic damping going on inside the CounterSycle tube - Seb measured the temperature of it immediately after a run of the DH track, and it was the same temperature as our static weight control. Inside the tube a brass piston is oscillating between two springs. The frequencies of vibration it is tuned to attenuate are in the region of 8-10 hz (not the higher frequency vibrations that we associate with a buzzing in the bar). Mounted vertically via the steerer tube, the CounterSycle's weight is displaced inside the unit when your front wheel hits a bump. As the force is transmitted through the fork and the frame accelerates upwards, the weight actually moves down relative to the tube, out of phase with it, as the lower spring compresses. The designer, Nathan Looney, tells us that the unit is directional. He says that in order to avoid bottom-out clunk, the lower spring is twice as long as the upper spring. The upper spring serves only to 'catch' the brass weight as it is thrown upwards by the lower spring's rebound, pushing it back onto the lower spring to reset. CounterShox market the CounterSycle TMD as a device to improve chassis stability, improve traction, and reduce rider fatigue through allowing the bike's suspension to work more efficiently. They have had a similar unit in production for motocross for a few years now, but only recently have they turned their attention to mountain bikes. Impressively, their debut entry went straight to the pointy end of the sport; a significant proportion of the World Cup DH field equipped their bike with the CounterSycle last season, including Amaury Pierron, Myriam Nicole, and Loris Vergier. Installation Getting the CounterSycle set up is fairly straight-forward once you've figured out the clearance above and below the unit. The mount consists of a bracket with two clamps; one that clamps to your steerer tube as a 5mm spacer, the other clamping the TMD. Both Seb and I had to mount the TMD offset of center to allow it to clear the bottom of the stem. I don't foresee any insurmountable compatibility issues with it, though riders with a very short head tube who like to run a very low stem position will want to be mindful of the clearance between the base of the TMD and the arch of the fork at full compression. Our TMD was 117mm long and mounting it in its lowermost position (with the clamp high up on the shaft) leaves 107mm of the TMD sitting below the clamp. You can swivel the clamp on the steerer tube so it's not in the path of the arch and there is a pinch bolt on the steerer clamp to prevent rotation, but it wouldn't be impossible for the mount to rotate on the steerer while you're riding (or crashing), with the resultant risk of the arch smashing into the base of the TMD - so, checking that clearance is advised. If there is a clearance issue, running the TMD will necessitate positioning the stem higher up the steerer, perhaps leaving the rider wanting to maintain their original bar height with a different rise bar. It's also not impossible that the TMD would damage the frame in a bad crash so it's probably a good idea to fashion a bumper for your headtube. Testing Info It is rare to test a product that we actually know so little about, and even rarer to test a component of an entirely new category. To make this as fair a test as possible, and to eliminate the risk of suffering from the placebo effect, Seb and I conducted double-blinded back-to-back testing of the CounterSycle against an almost identical control provided by CounterShox. The control was very similar in weight to the real TMD (366 g versus 380 g), and it looks the same, but it doesn't have a suspended weight inside it. The only way to know which one you are holding is to shake it; you can feel the weight inside the real TMD being displaced. There is a very quiet noise associated with its movement but you can't hear it while riding. To test the unit, we spent a day lapping a downhill track that we are both very familiar with - myself on a Marin Alpine Trail and Seb on a Privateer 161 . Conditions were dry, and the ground was hard pack and rough, and a little loose in places. The track consists of big swooping berms, fast wash-board sections, steeper sections that require very hard braking on rocky ground, big compressions and a couple of small jumps. Armed with two real TMDs and two control units, we went about the day swapping the units for one another, blinded on any given run as to which of the two was bolted to the bike. After each run, we guessed which of the two units we were running before removing it and shaking it to find out if we were correct. As we were randomly selecting unit each time, we didn't get a straight 50/50 split between runs with the TMD and runs with the control. The Results I completed eight runs of the downhill track, the first three with the real TMD - knowingly. Thereafter, I was blinded to which of the two units - real TMD or Control - was bolted to my bike. Following my fourth run of the day, I reported that the bike felt more planted but also more harsh, and that the bumps more jarring than they had felt on the previous runs. I guessed that, with the notable difference in ride feel, my unit had been switched to the Control. I was correct. On my fifth run of the day, I reported that the bike felt more lively and that the rougher sensations I had experienced on the previous run were smoother in comparison. With that change, I guessed that my fifth run of the day had been with the real TMD. I was correct. Thereafter, I incorrectly guessed that my 6th and 7th run were with the Control unit, reporting those rougher, jarring sensations again, and more fatigue. My final run of the day was by far the worst, and a little erratic in places. Comparatively, the runs felt very rough and harsh, and I felt a little unstable at times. I guessed correctly that I was on the Control unit that time. Of the five runs wherein I was blinded to which of the units I was running, I guessed correctly three times, and incorrectly two times. As I'm sure you can appreciate, it is hard to draw a firm conclusion about any purported performance benefits of the TMD from this data set alone. I was unable to consistently perceive a ride feel difference between the real TMD and the Control, and therefore I can't - at this stage - recommend that anyone spend $275 USD of their hard-earned cash on one. However, my initial positive reports of an improved ride feel have been enough to pique my interest such that I'd like to continue testing it. Any further testing I do with the CounterSycle will be under the same blinded back-to-back conditions for the avoidance of any confirmation bias. — Jessie-May Morgan Science is hard. We decided to randomly pick either the real TMD or the control for each run because, with an alternating \"ABAB\" approach, you know it's going to be different each time, so if you guess right once, you guess right every single time. The trouble with making it random is that there's a chance you get the same one many times in a row, reducing the number of times you get to experience the direct comparison. This is what happened to me - I happened to pick up the TMD four times in a row. In hindsight, a better method might have been to randomly pick one of the options (TMD or control)  for one run, then pick the other for the second run, then repeat as many times as possible. As the day came to a close, I decided to use my last two runs this way, picking one at random, then swapping to the other option for the last run. Taken together, of the five runs where I didn't know which I was riding, I guessed correctly four times, although I only got to switch between the control to the TMD twice, and I guessed correctly on both occasions. When I switched from the control to the TMD at the start of the test, or the other way around at the end of the test, I'm fairly sure I had less hand and arm fatigue towards the end of the run with the real TMD. I was doing full runs quite consistently, and my hands were flagging by the end each time. It's impossible to be sure with the limited number of back-to-back comparisons, but it's enough to make me think there might be something in it. What's the takeaway? If you're looking to leave no stone unturned to minimise hand/arm fatigue, I'd say the CounterSycle is worth a shot. But if there is a benefit, it's pretty subtle - most people would be better off focusing on optimising their suspension setup, tire pressures and handlebar choice first. Otherwise, it's hard to recommend spending the $275 asking price based on our testing so far. — Seb Stott"

        "content": "Interview: Rider Reactions After the 2025 Pietra Ligure Enduro World Cup: The 2025 Enduro World Cup series opened with an incredible weekend of racing in Pietra Ligure. After two huge days of racing, we caught up with some of the racers about how their weekends went in Italy. Ella Conolly A stage win and second overall at round one, how do you feel the race went for you? The race went pretty smoothly for me! It was insane to start the season with a stage win on the longest stage of the race. I was chasing hard after that, but couldn’t match Hattie! To get through two huge days of racing with no mechanicals or crashes feels like a huge success. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? Originally, there were some tight liaisons, but we gave some feedback in practice and they added some time to the longest liaison. I think staying calm on the liaisons helped me massively in the stages. I feel pretty comfortable with big pedalling days, so my approach on the stages was the same as always, push as hard as possible! Jesse Melamed A tough first stage this weekend, what happened there? Just an unlucky puncture. You can go all winter without a flat and then hit a rock at the exact point to ruin your race. It was in a nothing corner and there must have just been a really sharp rock in the perfect place, completely tore open the sidewall. You were able to come back and take the win on stage three. Was that more like the result you were expecting at round one? Of course, I was really happy to win that stage and show the speed is there. It’s good to know the pieces of the puzzle are all there and I just need to put it together. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? My approach was to take it stage by stage. It was an awesome weekend and everyone really enjoyed themselves, all through the shared suffering. The feed zones were great so we could really focus on water intake and make sure we were fuelling well all day. That was key. Hattie Harnden You won five of the seven stages this weekend. Were you expecting such a big result this weekend? No, I wasn’t expecting the weekend to go that well! I knew I have been riding well over the winter, but you just never actually know until you go against the clock. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? There were some big stages and long liaisons, but I think we were given good time to get between the stages. I just knew that I needed to eat more than I wanted, in order to keep my energy levels up with it being 4 days back to back. It’s so easy to not eat and drink enough early on. I very much just did my best to ride each stage the best I could, not worrying about what other people were doing. I know if I try my best, that’s all I have to give and it either will or won’t be enough to be the fastest Your focus is more on downhill this year. Does the win here make you want to race more enduros this season? I’d love to race more enduro this year, but there just isn’t time to fit it all in unfortunately. I am definitely a little sad to not be racing enduro the rest of the season, I just feel like I have found my feet and got the hang of what you need to do to win an enduro World Cup. But at the same time, I’m excited about the new challenge of going to DH. Simona Kuchyňková A great result for your first elite World Cup. How did the race go for you? Not gonna lie, it was the hardest 4 days on the bike for me. Finishing 8th after this sufferfest is a good result to kick off the season! Highlight of the race is definitely 3rd place on Stage 3, that one felt very special! What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? Sometimes I felt like I was exploring the jungle with my friends, and on the other hand, like I was racing marathon, as some of the liaisons were very tight. I think my approach changed mainly because we did the whole loop in practice, so I knew what I was getting into. Everyone was struggling, and I appreciate everyone who finished! Sławomir Łukasik That was an incredibly close race. How do you feel about taking second place this weekend? I’m always very happy to be on the podium and that small gap between me and Dan Booker proves that I need to push everywhere to the last finish stage. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? I knew that it will be hard but I like long days on the bike. I planned my nutrition very carefully and tried to save energy between stages. Next weekend we are back in Poland, has this weekend given you confidence to try again for the win you just missed last year? I’m trying not to think about the win, I’m more focus on riding well and I believe if everything comes together I will be able to take the win. Charlie Murray 11th place this weekend, how did the race go for you? Stoked with 11th tbh, it’s been a tough off season so was happy to race again and finding some race pace again. We saw you swapped for a RockShox Zeb during practice. Can you share your thoughts behind the change, and did it work out across the race days? The Zeb ended up being great, think I just needed a bit more confidence and it provided that. Still love the Lyrik, so I will have to decide on what I run at future races! 10mm more travel and not having to need it so firm was the main difference. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? My approach to racing was just fuelling correctly and wearing the right kit. I went for shorts as I knew we would be in for a hot day. Morgane Charre Third place at round one, how do you feel the race went for you? The race went pretty good for me, it was a big one with two days racing and some very long stages. Overall, I’m really happy with my race, no big issue except a little excursion off the track on stage 2 where I had to walk back on track. I feel like it was a solid race for me even if I was a little bit off the winning pace. The stages were really fun, so it’s a great start to the season. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? For sure, it was a very big race and with one of the liaison being a lot of hike a bike it took a lot of energy. But overall, the liaison times were very good, I didn’t stop too much after each stage and just started to go to the next one at a good pace and it was ok. My main focus on the liaisons was to try to hydrate and eat enough to keep some energy going until the end of the race. Jack Moir First World Cup back after injury, how was the return to racing? Yeah, it has been a loonnggg off season, so was good to be back pushing myself again. You were leading after day one. Was that a surprise, or did you know you were having a good day? Yeah, that was definitely a surprise. That felt pretty cool to know that everything I have been doing is working and I’m riding good. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? Nothing special. Just tried to take it easy on all the liaisons and keep up the food and water. You lost a lot of time on the fourth stage. Can you explain what happened? Yeah, definitely disappointed about that. Just misread the track and didn’t realise the turn was as tight as it was. I came in too hot and went off the bank and lost a lot of time trying to climb back on track Raphaela Richter A stage win and fourth overall, how did the race go for you? Phew, it’s been tough but also so rewarding to push my limits. I enjoyed that type of racing again and I was in a good headspace and in the zone during the stages. It felt a bit like a dream, especially on day one. Glad I could up my pace even a little more on the second day! What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? I knew it was going to be hard. I‘m at a point now that I know that I’m probably not the only one who‘s struggling or has to survive the day. It’s best to do one step at a time and not think ahead too much. During practice, I meticulously looked at how long the liaisons take so I know where I’m at during the race. Winni Goldsbury A great result for your first elite World Cup. How do you rate your race this weekend? The race was awesome I loved the two day setup, it was definitely a challenge to keep pushing for the full two days, but it was an amazing experience and I was stoked with some of my stage results, especially stage two when I got top three with a crash! What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? The transfers were pretty good I thought, the only one I was stressed about was the first transition today because it took longer than I expected. My favourite transfer was the long one between stage one and two, because it reminded me of New Zealand and made me feel at home! My approach to the racing was to have fun and keep on keeping on, even when my legs felt like they were going to collapse! Ryan Gilchrist Top five at round one, how did the first race of the season go for you? A career best for me, first ever stage win and a very good day for Australia and Yeti. I think I found my intensity as the race day(s) progressed and a crystal ball would have given me some helpful insights, but all things considered, I had a dilemma-free weekend with some very high-level riding both physically and technically. I've got a lot to be proud of. What was your approach to the big stage transfers and potentially tight liaison times this weekend? Transfers weren't tight at all, they were very relaxed and at times felt like go-slow competitions. With it being a 4 day format (2 practice, 2 race) I knew it would be a battle of attrition by the end and people would be suffering on the long stages so I made it my business to nail my nutrition and conserve as much as energy as possible to take my body to the line as strong as possible. What’s your hope for the rest of the season after a great result at round one? More good times ahead for 2025. I'm off to Poland tomorrow morning and will be flying back to Australia for Crankworx Cairns to continue pursuing that overall. I've got a lot of kettles on the boil this season and I'm pretty keen to make a bunch of tasty cups of tea!"

Naturally, a city of such stature required a bevy of 'watering holes', saloons that served stiff drinks to be precise, and that's where Whiskey Row was born. These days, the local cowboys prefer their steeds with two wheels, and their calling is the sound of knobby tires on sweet singletrack. For one glorious weekend of the year, the Whiskey Off-Road calls this town and famous stretch of history its home. For the last twenty years, the Whiskey Off-Road has celebrated these modern cowboys and cowgirls with a fat tire crit, beer gardens, all sorts of industry and local vendors showing off their wares, live music, and, most importantly, a good day on the bike with a 15-mile, 25-mile, and the ultimate backcountry 50-mile race on tap for all.

        "content": "2025 Pietra Ligure Enduro World Cup Final Results: The 2025 Enduro World Cup series opening round continues after an incredible first day of racing. The initial test of the world's best this season produced incredible riding, epic liaisons and a mid-race downpour to soak the riders and stages. For day two, racers faced a 42.90km course with nearly 1,700m of climbing in another gruelling test of skill and endurance. Keep scrolling to see a breakdown of each stage and the final results. Day 2 Course Map Final Results Pietra Ligure has delivered some incredible racing to kick off the 2025 Enduro World Cup series, showcasing two days of racing with a total distance of around 100 kilometres, including liaisons. After seven timed stages, we have the final results from Italy. In the Junior Men's racing, Melvin Almueis took the lead on stage one and never left the top position. Picking up two stage wins on his way to the round one victory, Almueis faced challengers across each stage, but he still ended the weekend with a lead of 14 seconds against Millwood Cooper. Completing the overall top three and the only rider within a minute of Almueis, Italian racer Matteo Falcini secured a great result on home soil. The Junior Women's race produced another French victor as Lucile Metge finished the two racing days with a lead of almost two minutes. Metge faced a close battle with Elise Porta until the final stage, where Porta took a DNF. With a DNF for Porta, Lacey Adams stepped into the second-place spot, with Yeti teammate Chloe Bear in third. After winning five of the seven stages, Hattie Harnden wins the Elite Women's Pietra Ligure World Cup. While Harnden is focusing on Downhill this season, she proved this weekend that she is still the one to beat in the longer-format gravity World Cup discipline. Ending the two days 24 seconds back, Ella Conolly had a great ride to kick off the season and will be one to watch for the overall title, with Harnden absent for most of this year's events. Morgane Charre took the final podium spot and was the only other rider within a minute of Harnden. In a close battle for the race win, the final stage decided the victory in the Elite Men's racing. After showing consistency across all seven stages, Dan Booker was victorious in Pietra Ligure, fighting off Slawomir Lukasik in the final moments. With just 0.374 seconds splitting the leading pair after 43 minutes of racing, it was incredibly close between the leading racers. Ending his weekend in third, World Champ Alex Rudeau also had a great start to the 2025 series. Junior Men: 1st. Melvin Almueis: 44:53.809 2nd. Cooper Millwood: 45:08.527 // +14.718 3rd.

Ryan Gilchrist: 43:09.603 // +8.836 Day 1 Recap On the first day of racing in Pietra Ligure, riders battled across three stages with a total distance of 57.78 kilometres, including liaisons. In the Junior Men's race, there were three unique stage winners, as Melvin Almueis, Gabriel Sainthuile and Cooper Millwood battled for the lead into day two. After totalling the times after the three stages, stage one winner Almueis holds the advantage with a gap of 0.336 seconds to Sainthuile after all three timed stages. Millwood holds third place, 10.9 back. Despite winning just one of three stages, Lucile Metge holds onto the overall Junior Women’s lead into day two, even after finishing fourth on stage three. The competition remains close, with stage one and three winner, Elise Porta, only 2.122 behind. Yeti teammates Lacey Adams and Chloe Bear may already be out of touch for the win, as with mostly short stages on day two, their deficits of over a minute will be almost impossible to close. For the Elite Women, it was business as usual for Hattie Harnden, as her two stage wins placed her into the lead after day one. The 2024 overall series champ will start the second day of racing with a 9.7-second advantage over Ella Conolly after neither racer dropped outside the top three. Morgane Charre is the next closest racer to Harnden, although with a 20-second deficit and as most stages on day two are around one kilometre, this could be a tough gap to close. Jack Moir made a big return to Enduro World Cup racing, securing the lead into day two after recovering from a season-ending injury in 2024. Taking back-to-back stage wins to start the day and third place on stage three, Moir secured a four-second advantage. Showing consistency throughout the day, Slawomir Lukasik holds second place with no stage finish lower than sixth. Dan Booker finishes day one as the only other racer within 12 seconds of Moir. You can view a full breakdown of the results here . Stage Results Stage 4 Following some overnight rest, riders were back on course in Pietra Ligure for another big day on the bike. Starting the second day of racing, riders headed out onto a 7.5-kilometre liaison with around 314 metres of climbing to the start of stage one. Once there, they prepared for Spillpietra, the second longest stage of day two at 1.92 kilometres. First out of the gate was the Junior Men, and Cooper Millwood opened the day with his second stage victory of the weekend. Falling 5.5 seconds back from Millwood, current race leader Melvin Almueis secured second place before Simone Leo in third. Almueis still hangs onto his race lead with a 4.1-second gap to Gabriel Sainthuile. Millwood has closed the gap to the race leader and, after starting the day over 10 seconds behind, is now 5.4 seconds back. In the four-rider Junior women's category, Lucile Metge also took a second stage win in Pietra Ligure as she just pulled ahead of Elise Porta by 0.155. Chloe Bear and Lacey Adams gave up more time to the two French racers as they were both over 12 seconds off the winning pace. In the overall race standings, it remains close between Metge and Porta, with just 2.277 seconds separating the leading pair. Hattie Harnden makes it three wins out of four stages as she continues to dominate the racing this weekend. As Harnden rides her way into becoming the first elite rider to win an Enduro World Cup with a belt-driven gearbox bike, Ella Conolly is ensuring the competition remains close. Conolly has yet to drop outside the top two positions across all stages. Splitting the top two by 1.8 seconds, there was a bigger gap to third-placed Raphaela Richter, as she was 6.6 seconds from Harnden. In the overall race, the stage four victory extends Harnden's advantage over Conolly beyond ten seconds. 2024 Enduro World Champion Alex Rudeau is flying out of the start on day two as he takes the stage win by 1.9 seconds. Continuing a great weekend, Dan Booker slots into second place behind the World Champ, with Ryan Gilchrist leading a trio of Yeti teammates in third. It's a disastrous start to the day for Jack Moir as he lost 14 seconds and finished in 39th. Moir said in a post-stage interview he forgot which part of the stage he was at and \"sent it off a bank.\" In the overall race, Moir lost his lead, falling to fourth in the standings. Booker, who has shown great consistency so far in Pietra Ligure, jumped from third to first after stage four. It's a small lead, with Slawomir Lukasik only 0.219 seconds back.

Jack Moir: 30:37.539 // +5.934 5th. Ryan Gilchrist: 30:44.359 // +12.754 Stage 5 Stage five saw racers tackle another monster stage with a 3.51-kilometre route across Fedeli alla Linea with a total descent of 686 metres. Before they even got to the third longest stage of the weekend, there was a brutal liaison of 14 kilometres with an elevation change of 791 metres. Melvin Almueis won the Junior Men's stage five as he pushed hard to make the most of its extended length and the chance to create a big gap. Sitting in second place, Cooper Millwood fell just short of matching his stage four win, falling behind Almueis by 13.6 seconds. Martin Lahellec made it two French racers inside the top three as he secured third, 21 seconds behind the stage leader. Looking at the overall standings, the big win for Almueis on stage five propelled him further into the lead with a gap of 19 seconds to Millwood, who moved up from third to second. It was another close result in the Junior Women's race, this time Elise Porta pulled ahead by fractions of a second. Race leader Lucile Metge fell behind Porta by just 0.137 seconds as the French racers were locked in a very close battle for the first World Cup win of 2025. Metge still led the overall race standings, but only 2.140 seconds split the front runners. Hattie Harnden's control of the Elite Women's racing remained untouched after picking up another stage win. Stage five saw Harnden create huge gaps amongst the top racers as the top five were split by almost 30 seconds. Riding closest to Harnden, Ella Conolly ended her fifth stage of the weekend 9.3 seconds back. A big win on stage five for Harnden meant she was comfortably in the lead with two stages remaining. Conolly was over 20 seconds behind, with third-placed Morgane Charre 45 seconds off the total stage time of Harnden. The Yeti team dominated the stage five results for the Elite Men with a lockout of the top three positions. Taking the top honours, Ryan Gilchrist bested Richie Rude by 2.4 seconds and Slawomir Lukasik by 3.2 seconds. These results shook up the overall race standings as Lukasik overtook Dan Booker to move into the lead position. Gilchrist also improved his position, passing Jack Moir to go fourth.

Jack Moir: 39:05.071 // +9.658 Stage 6 Traversing the midpoint of the day's racing, the liaison was fairly short at around six kilometres with an elevation change of 161 metres. The third day two stage was Gabry, a 0.99-kilometre trail with a total descent of 105 metres. Stage six was the second shortest of the weekend, containing the least vertical drop of all seven stages. The battle between Copper Millwood and Melvin Almueis in the Junior Men's race continued into stage six. This time, Millwood secured the stage victory and, more importantly, took 3.3 seconds out of Almueis' overall race lead. With one more stage left, Almueis looked secure with a lead of 15.7 seconds against Millwood. Chloe Bear took her first stage win of the weekend with the US racer pulling ahead of Junior Women's race leader, Lucile Metge, by 3.8 seconds. Stage six was a disaster for Elise Porta, who up to this point had been in a close battle for the race win. After dropping back by 37 seconds, Porta was out of contention for the win in Pietra Ligure. With one stage to go, we saw the first winner who is not Hattie Harnden or Ella Conolly, as Raphaela Richter set the best time on the sixth stage. Pulling ahead of Andreane Lanthier Nadeau by 0.043 seconds, Richter broke the British control over the Elite Women's racing. Taking third, Harnden lost two seconds. Ahead of the final stage, Harnden's lead was around 23 seconds to Conolly before Morgane Charre in third. Alex Rudeau was back on top after securing a second stage win on day two in Pietra Ligure. Missing out on his first stage win in 2025, Richie Rude took 2nd, 0.145 seconds back from Rudeau. Greg Callaghan was also within a second of the 2024 World Champ's winning stage time, taking third place. Slawomir Lukasik remained the overall race leader with one stage left and Dan Booker 2.6 seconds behind in second place. Jack Moir jumped back up to fourth place overall after taking fifth on stage six.

Armuin was the shortest stage of the race with a length of 0.98 kilometres. A quick stage to finish off the race meant any large time gaps were impossible to close. Cooper Millwood concluded his race weekend in the Junior Men's category with another stage victory. Millwood pulled ahead of Melvin Almueis to secure the win by 1.016 seconds. Simone Leo completed the top three, 2.88 back. Lucile Metge went fastest again for the Junior Women as she bested Chloe Bear by 1.6 seconds in the final stage of round one. After battling for the overall win across most of the seven stages, it was sad to see Elise Porta end the race in Pietra Ligure with a DNF. Closing out an incredibly successful weekend, Hattie Harnden took another stage win as she was only beaten on two of the seven Pietra Ligure stages. Winning stage seven by 0.232 seconds, Harnden denied Raphaela Richter back-to-back stage victories. Canadian racer, Elly Hoskin, had a great ride on stage seven, placing third and only 0.759 seconds back from Harnden. What an end to the Elite Men's race! Dan Booker put it all on the line as he stormed to the final stage win, beating 2024 World Champ Alex Rudeau by over a second. The short final stage saw flat pedals come out on top as Booker, a privateer racer, beat the world's best, pushing himself into the overall lead to secure the World Cup victory.

At the heart of this trail lies the Mega Drop! Only two riders have hit this massive, high-consequence feature so far: my digging partner Josh Lichti and I. So when Remy Metailler wanted to come out and see the line in person, I knew it would be a wild session. What surprised Rémy most wasn’t just the size of the drop, but the mental commitment it demanded. I rode it a handful of times and worked through some of the newly finished features farther down the trail, hoping it might help him feel it out. In situations like this, watching someone else ride something doesn’t guarantee you’re mentally ready. That headspace is everything when it comes to riding on the edge of risk and reward. This video dives into what progression at the highest level really looks like—not just in the air, but in your mindset. Did Remy go for it? Watch the video to find out. - Photo by Max Berkowitz"

        "content": "Race Recap: Dirtlej Epic Enduro 2025: The Legend As legend has it, the Epic Enduro is no ordinary race – it's as much a sporting feat as it is a personal challenge. With more than 120 km of racing and 4,900 meters of climbing and descending across three loops in a single day – all by bike – riders must master both body and mind to tame this exceptional enduro rally course. The goal: beat every time gate and earn the coveted Gold Epic. But the wild and mesmerizing Caroux Mountains are not easily conquered! For those brave enough to take on the challenge but fall short of the ultimate prize, a Silver Epic awaits those who complete the first two loops, and a Bronze Epic awaits those who finish the first. A solid reason to return stronger next year… Once again, this year, tradition held firm: over 300 riders lined up at 4:15 a.m. sharp. After a stormy and rain-drenched Saturday, participants were greeted by a starry sky at dawn. The rain stayed away, but wet trails and slick terrain made for a treacherous start. Riders took off from the town square in Olargues – 300 strong – charging into the first loop. Strategies varied: some went full gas to avoid crowds, others conserved energy and aimed to avoid racing in the dark. A mystical vibe settled in during the early stages – glowing headlamps, quiet trails, and highly motivated riders. After 2 or 3 stages, the sun finally rose and lit up the mountains, warming both bodies and spirits. The fastest riders had already crushed the first 45 kilometres. Those who completed Loop 1 in under 3h45 were cleared to continue to Loop 2: four more stages and 1,600 m of climbing. Shorter, but rougher. The first transfer required a long hike-a-bike and push to reach the 1,000-meter summit of Montahut. The view was breathtaking – as was the legendary stage descending from it: over 12 minutes of trail for the elite, and closer to 20 for most. Stage 5, a fresh creation by young local trail builders, delivered pure flow, berms, and playful jumps over 2 minutes of joy. Then came the rugged Bardou massif, known for its never-ending rock gardens. At this point, riders had already racked up 3,000 meters of elevation, and yet the stoke remained high. Those who completed the first 85 km in under 8h30 could attempt the final loop – the Gold Epic quest – provided they had enough fuel left in the tank… and serious grit. Loop 3 meant five more stages, starting with the infamous \"Crêtes XXL\" – the steepest, most feared, and most glorious stage on the course. Then came \"Mini Jurassick,\" where precision weaving between trees was essential. A short climb brought riders to “Le Pin”: 8 minutes of speed, tech, tight forest turns and open sections with sweeping views of the Orb valley. Everything that makes a stage unforgettable. But it didn’t end there. One last brutal climb brought riders to the final segments. Many would stop here, exhausted or out of time. Those who carried on faced the fearsome \"Pylônes\" stage – perhaps the most technical of the race, and still brutally physical. The organizers could’ve wrapped things up gently… but that wouldn’t be worthy of the legend. Finally, riders crossed the finish line – wrecked, but overwhelmed with emotion. Pride, relief, and joy from completing a challenge many had trained months, even years for. The EPIC truly is one-of-a-kind. New in 2025: The Two-Day Ultra E-Epic supported by Bosch This year brought a brand-new challenge for e-bike riders looking to push their machines to the limit: the Ultra E-Epic, spread over two days. Saturday featured two loops in mass-start format, beginning with the long climb from Bardou to Saint-Martin-du-Froid – a 30-minute technical effort where bike handling and fitness played equal roles. Rain made things even harder. After a neutralized zone, riders dropped into a 15-minute descent through the morning mist – a chance to claw back lost time with technical commitment. A pit stop allowed for battery swaps before heading out for a final 20 km loop alternating climbs and descents. Hugo Pigeon took the win ahead of E-XCO World Champion Jérôme Gilloux and legend Rémy Absalon. Results were based on points, not cumulative time. Sunday, Ultra E-Epic riders joined the classic Epic start and scored points for each completed loop. Hugo Pigeon kept up his dominance by winning the first two loops. Catalan rider Damien Oton rocketed into 2nd place after taking Loop 3. Rémy Absalon secured 3rd with consistency. Gilloux, after being in podium contention all weekend, dropped to 6th due to a flat tire. Florian Golay climbed to 4th, edging out Emeric Ienzer. In the women’s field, Sofia Wiedenroth, E-XCO World Champion, raced solo all weekend, finishing in the top 15 overall – among the men. Dirtlej Epic Enduro by MET: 2025 Champions In the classic Epic Enduro, Glenn McArthur took the lead from Loop 1 and never looked back. After several podiums, he finally claimed the top step with a total of 1h03 in timed stages. Behind him, a fierce battle unfolded. With an incredible final push – including three stage wins – Maël Ferron claimed 2nd place, just 55 seconds off the lead. Gabriel Torralba secured 3rd with impressive consistency. Kilian Bron just missed the podium after a crash in Stage 11 but still finished 4th, 8 seconds ahead of former winner Patrick Luthi, who staged a strong comeback after a cautious start. In the women’s race, two heroines completed all three loops: Morgane Jonnier took the win ahead of Julie Perea, who dug deep to finish. The strong Belgian rider Turpjin narrowly missed the final time gate despite a promising ride. Master 35: Win for Antoine Pirlot Master 45: The UK’s Ian Austermuhle upset 2024 winner Greg Noce Juniors: Pierre Nitschke completed the full course and won the category ahead of Ethan Flanquart, who also earned a Gold Epic In the team relay (3 riders, each completing one loop), the MGT team triumphed ahead of X1 Racing and MDN Performance. Shout-out to the all-women Dream Team for their performance and spirit. An Unforgettable Edition Once again, the Dirtlej Epic Enduro by MET lived up to the hype. The Débrou team put in hundreds of hours to maintain and fine-tune the 30 km of special stages. Over 100 volunteers helped make the event smooth, fun, and safe. The crew from Vélo Caroux and Loizo Rider Productions orchestrated a flawless event from start to finish. Out of 300 entrants, 114 “acoustic” riders completed the full course to earn Gold. Many lefts with Silver or Bronze – already major accomplishments. But others are already eyeing 2026… chasing that elusive gold medal. No one leaves the Caroux unchanged."

        "content": "Race Analysis from the 2025 Pietra Ligure Enduro World Cup: The 2025 Enduro World Cup season is here, and with it a return of huge multi-day races that truly test the skills of the world's best. After a challenging two-day race in Italy, we have collected the stats and dived into the numbers from the first stop of the 2025 Enduro World Cup season.

Hugo Marti: 46:16.743 // +1:22.934 Story of the Race: Elite Women Hattie Harnden produced a dominant show of strength at the first stop of the Enduro World Cup series, winning five of the seven stages. Harnden only missed out on the fastest times on the first and sixth stages as she piloted a belt-driven gearbox bike to its first World Cup victory. Stage one winner Ella Conolly kept the pressure on Harnden as she rode a consistent race to finish 2nd. Morgane Charre was the only other rider within a minute of Harnden and secured the final podium spot. Top 10 Results: 1st. Hattie Harnden: 48:02.801 2nd. Ella Conolly: 48:27.177 // +24.376 3rd. Morgane Charre: 48:54.359 // +51.558 4th. Raphaela Richter: 49:07.175 // +1:04.374 5th. Mélanie Pugin: 49:34.693 // +1:31.892 6th. Andreane Lanthier Nadeau: 49:53.289 // +1:50.488 7th. Winnifred Goldsbury: 49:53.607 // +1:50.806 8th. Simona Kuchynkova: 50:02.041 // +1:59.240 9th. Elly Hoskin: 50:19.044 // +2:16.243 10th. Nadine Ellecosta: 50:24.118 // +2:21.317 Story of the Race: Kicking off the day with a long first stage, Ella Conolly took an early lead, building a 4.6-second advantage against the eventual race winner Hattie Harnden. By the next stage, the lead had vanished, with Harnden winning stage two by over 12 seconds and pulling into the race lead by eight seconds. With a mix of long and short stages in Pietra Ligure, it was important to make the most of any chance to take some big time advantages which couldn't;t be pulled back in the shorter timed trails. By the end of the first day and three stages, Harnden had built a nine-second lead against Conolly. Moving into the second day's stages Harnden showed no sign of slowing down, building her lead across the final four stages to reach a little over 24 seconds at the end of the weekend. The only slight sign of weakness came on stage six, but with it being a short stage and only two seconds lost, it did not affect the overall race lead. Stage Breakdown: Looking closer at the stage-winning margins, the big attacks came from Harnden's victories on stages two and five, where she rode 12 and nine seconds clear at the front. While Harnden's 12.69-second victory on stage two was the largest winning margin in seconds, her stage five win was a slightly larger victory when looking at the percentage of the total time. The stage five win produced a 1.65% victory while the stage two win was 1.63%. Both stages two and five were some of the longest across the weekend, and by pushing to take the wins her,e Harnden was able to secure some huge time gaps that weren't possible to shut down on the shorter stages of around two minutes. Overall Standings: Elite Men Enduro racing doesn't get much closer than the Elite Men's racing at round one. Coming down to the final stage, Dan Booker's rapid ride across stage seven secured him a first World Cup win as he pulled ahead of Slawomir Lukasik by 0.374 seconds. It was another narrow miss for Lukasik as he still searches for an Enduro World Cup win outside of the E-EDR format. World Champ, Alex Rudeau, provided a strong representation of the rainbow stripes with a third-place finish and only 4.7 seconds back after 43 minutes of racing. Top 10 Results: 1st. Dan Booker: 43:00.767 2nd. Slawomir Lukasik: 43:01.141 // +0.374 3rd. Alex Rudeau: 43:05.486 // +4.719 4th. Jack Moir: 43:09.558 // +8.791 5th. Ryan Gilchrist: 43:09.603 // +8.836 6th. Richie Rude: 43:12.276 // +11.509 7th. Zakarias Blom Johansen: 43:33.819 // +33.052 8th. William Brodie: 43:38.680 // +37.913 9th. Bailey Christie: 43:39.172 // +38.405 10th. Jt Fisher: 43:43.674 // +42.907 Story of the Race: After storming the first three stages with two wins and even a small crash, Jack Moir was the rider to beat after day one. A series of mistakes across the second race day meant Moir would fall off the pace of the leading riders, but he still finished the weekend in fourth, showing the speed is there if he can get a clean race. As the second day started, it became clear we were in for a battle between Dan Booker and Slawomir Lukasik. Booker kicked off the second day with a jump into first place, following a second-place finish on stage four. Lukasik wasn't far off the lead with 0.219 seconds separating the two racers. A Yeti one-two-three on stage five saw Lukasik move into the lead with an advantage of 3.258 seconds against Booker. Following the first of two short final stages, Booker closed the gap to Lukasik slightly, but with a deficit of 2.669 seconds, it looked unlikely that the gap could be closed. With everything relying on the final stage, a wild ride from Booker, seeing him go fastest, and a ninth place for Lukasik propelled the Australian racer into the overall race lead by a slim margin of 0.374 seconds. Unlike in women's racing, where big stage wins secured the win, Booker took his first World Cup win by showing great consistency across the stages with no finish lower than eighth. Stage Breakdown: Across all seven stages, the racing was close for the Elite Men, with no victory producing a margin of over 1% or 2.5 seconds. Unlike the Elite Women's race, where the big stages produced large gaps of at or above ten seconds, these stages were far closer for the men. With the largest margins in seconds sitting at 2.43 and the biggest percentage margin at 0.88, the physically demanding racing in Pietra Ligure was incredibly close. Overall Standings:"

        "content": "Review: Pivot Phoenix - Easily Accessible DH Speed: Pivot unveiled their new DH bike design on the World Cup back in 2023 via an eye-catching lugged carbon prototype. The production bike kept the wild-looking dual-chain drive, but went to a full-carbon frame - there aren't any machined lugs to be found. Some of the allure may have been lost by moving away from the CNC-lugged prototype, but that allowed Pivot to chop down the overall weight considerably. In fact, once team riders hopped on board the production bike, they had to add weights to the downtube to feel at home again. The Phoenix namesake has been around since 2010, but this latest version is the first time that Pivot has deviated from the standard DW-link suspension. The six-bar (DW6) also places the Phoenix in “mid” high-pivot territory. Phoenix Details • 210mm travel, 203mm fork • Carbon frame • DW6 suspension • MX wheels • Sizes: S1, S2 (tested), S3, S4 • 62.5 - 63° head angle • 440mm chainstays (all sizes) • Pricing: $7,499 - $8,899 USD • Frame kit (w/drive cogs & shock): $4,799 USD • Weight: 16.07 kg / 35.44 lb (S2) • pivotcycles.com Whether the Phoenix is at a bike park or World Cup race track, the dual-chain drive turns heads. It may be unconventional, but it's been reliable, secure, and best of all, doesn’t create a ton of drag. Contents Introduction Construction & Features Suspension Design Geometry & Sizing Setup Performance Value How Does it Compare? Technical Report Pros & Cons Pinkbike's Take Unconventional bikes always have my attention. If you hid all of the contraptions on the Phoenix, you wouldn't think anything of them. It's exceptional on the trail, and still intuitive to ride. — Matt Beer"

        "content": "2025 Pietra Ligure Enduro World Cup Day 1 Results: The Enduro World Cup series is back for 2025 and with it a return to the adventurous spirit of the early EWS era. As well as a big day in the saddle there is no tech zone for mid-race repairs or assistance. The 2025 season kicks off with a trip to the picturesque Finale Outdoor Region in the Italian Riviera for two days of racing across trails around Pietra Ligure. For day one, racers faced a 57.78km course with over 1,400m of climbing in a brutal test of descending skill and physical endurance. Keep scrolling to see a breakdown of each stage and the final results from the first day of racing in Italy. Day 1 Course Map Final Day 1 Results On the first day of racing in Pietra Ligure, riders battled across three stages with a total distance of 57.78 kilometres, including liaisons. In the Junior Men's race, there were three unique stage winners, as Melvin Almueis, Gabriel Sainthuile and Cooper Millwood battled for the lead into day two. After totalling the times after the three stages, stage one winner Almueis holds the advantage with a gap of 0.336 seconds to Sainthuile after all three timed stages. Millwood holds third place, 10.9 back. Despite winning just one of three stages, Lucile Metge holds onto the overall Junior Women’s lead into day two, even after finishing fourth on stage three. The competition remains close, with stage one and three winner, Elise Porta, only 2.122 behind. Yeti teammates Lacey Adams and Chloe Bear may already be out of touch for the win, as with mostly short stages on day two, their deficits of over a minute will be almost impossible to close. For the Elite Women, it was business as usual for Hattie Harnden, as her two stage wins placed her into the lead after day one. The 2024 overall series champ will start the second day of racing with a 9.7-second advantage over Ella Conolly after neither racer dropped outside the top three. Morgane Charre is the next closest racer to Harnden, although with a 20-second deficit and as most stages on day two are around one kilometre, this could be a tough gap to close. Jack Moir made a big return to Enduro World Cup racing, securing the lead into day two after recovering from a season-ending injury in 2024. Taking back-to-back stage wins to start the day and third place on stage three, Moir secured a four-second advantage. Showing consistency throughout the day, Slawomir Lukasik holds second place with no stage finish lower than sixth. Dan Booker finishes day one as the only other racer within 12 seconds of Moir. Quick Stats: Total Stage Length: 11.86km Total Stage Descent: 1941m Junior Men's Race Leader Average Stage Speed: 25.80km/h // 16.03mph Junior Women's Race Leader Average Stage Speed: 22.21km/h // 13.80mph Elite Women's Race Leader Average Stage Speed: 24.08km/h // 14.96mph Elite Men's Race Leader Average Stage Speed: 26.94km/h // 16.74mph Junior Men: 1st.

Dan Booker: 26:32.192 // +6.390 4th. Alex Rudeau: 26:38.674 // +12.872 5th. Ryan Gilchrist: 26:44.171 // +18.369 Stage Results Stage 1 Kicking off with the longest stage of the day and the whole race, riders faced a 5.89km challenge after a brutal transition from the start line. Following a 21km liaison taking racers up to an elevation of 1,272m, Isallo Extasy was the first stage of day one with a length of 5.89km and a vertical drop of 940m. The new Junior categories, a change from the U21 racing in previous years, were the first on course for day one, with the men setting off slightly ahead of the women's race. In the Junior men's racing, Melvin Almueis was one of the last riders to drop and the first to take a stage win in 2025. Ending the stage with a seven-second gap to 2nd place, the young French racer has had a great start to the day. Gabriel Sainthuile took the second-place spot, with Matteo Falcini 10.4 back in third. In the four-rider Junior women's category, another French rider set the top time as Elise Porta, of the Lapierre Gravity Collective, went 2.9 ahead of Lucile Metge. Metge was the only rider close to the fastest time, as the Yeti teammates Chloe Bear and Lacey Adam were over 36 seconds off the pace. After the demanding first stage, Ella Conolly took an early lead in the Elite Women's race after finding 1.329 seconds against Morgane Charre. Aon Racing's Hattie Harnden finished the stage 4.6 back from Conolly and was the last rider within 11 seconds of the stage leader. The long first stage has created some serious gaps amongst the top Elite Women, with 18 seconds splitting the top five and nearly 40 seconds separating the top ten racers. As this was the longest stage of the day and the weekend, any large gaps will be tricky to close on the shorter stages. Last down the stage, the Elite Men's racing produced the closest winning margin as Jack Moir marked his return to World Cup racing after injury with the fastest time. Moir finished the stage 0.43 seconds ahead of Slawomir Lukasik, who was battling for the win at last year's opening round in Finale Ligure before a mechanical pushed him down to fifth. Taking third on today's first stage, Dan Booker went four seconds back from Moir and placed ahead of the 2024 Enduro World Champion, Alex Rudeau. It appears that Jesse Melamed had trouble on stage one; he crossed the line over four and a half minutes back. Thanks to Bex Baraona, who is providing updates on social media from the Gowaan MTB account, we know Melamed suffered a flat tire during stage one. He was not the only top rider to suffer a flat as Dimitri Tordo also picked up a rear flat on the first stage. Quick Stats: Stage Name: Isallo Extasy Stage Length: 5.89km Total Descent: 940m Junior Men's Winning Average Speed: 26.81km/h // 16.66mph Junior Women's Winning Average Speed: 23.28km/h // 14.46mph Elite Women's Winning Average Speed: 25.33km/h // 15.74mph Elite Men's Winning Average Speed: 28.31km/h // 17.59mph Junior Men: 1st.

Dan Booker: 12:33.062 // +4.019 4th. Alex Rudeau: 12:36.054 // +7.011 5th. Bailey Christie: 12:39.912 // +10.869 Stage 2 With no time to rest after a brutal effort on the gruelling first stage, riders set off on a nearly 15km liaison to the second stage with around 777m of climbing. After transitioning to stage two, riders prepared to race Hiroshima Mon Amour, a 4.95km trail with a total descent of 730m. The second stage is slightly shorter than the first, but it’s still be a big effort and is the second-longest of the race. As there is only one more stage after this with a length of over two kilometres, this is a great chance for racers to create some big gaps that will be harder to find on the shorter stages. Starting with the Junior Men, we saw a new stage winner as Cooper Millwood beat Gabriel Sainthuile to the fastest time by 0.844 seconds. Falling nearly another three seconds back, the stage one victor, Melvin Almueis, secured third. In the overall race standings, Almueis holds onto the lead with a four-second advantage against Sainthuile. After winning stage two, Millwood moves into third and is a little over eight seconds back from the current race leader. Moving onto the Junior Women, we saw another fresh stage winner as Lucile Metge took a big win on the second stage. Beating the stage one winner, Elise Porta, by almost 19 seconds, Metge laid down an incredible performance on the nearly five-kilometre second stage. This time, third place went to Lacey Adams as Chloe Bear fell over a minute back from the stage winner. In the race standings, Metge jumps past Porta after her stage win to take the lead with a 16-second advantage. The 2024 overall series winner, Hattie Harnden, stormed to her first stage win of the season with a big gap of over twelve seconds to Ella Conolly. While Harnden may not be committing to a full season of Enduro racing she is showing no signs of slowing down, taking 12.6 seconds out of the stage one winner. Third place on stage two went to first-year Elite racer Winni Goldsbury, 13.59 behind the stage winner. After winning the stage, Harnden now leads with an advantage of eight seconds against Conolly going into the final stage of day one. Jack Moir rides to back-to-back stage wins as he is flying on the longer stages that start the weekend's racing in Pietra Ligure. Following Moir and the only rider within a second of the top stage time, Ryan Gilchrist, went 0.864 seconds back. Stage two saw a great result for Greg Callaghan as he squeezed into the top three with a run 1.4 seconds behind Moir. In the overall race standings, Moir stands at the top with a little over three seconds to Slawomir Lukasik. After finishing third on stage one and fourth on stage two, Dan Booker holds third place going into the final timed stage of day one.

Ending the first day with one of the shorter stages racers will face this weekend, Dolcenera, sees a battle across 1.02 kilometres with a total descent of 210 metres. The short third stage produced another new winner in the Junior Men's race, with Gabriel Sainthuile taking the top honours after placing 2nd in the previous two stages. Melvin Almueis ended his day with a second place on stage three, giving up 3.7 seconds to Sainthuile. Completing the top three, stage two winner Cooper Millwood finished the stage 6.639 seconds back. Elise Porta backed up a stage one victory with the fastest time on stage three in the Junior Women's racing. Porta wrapped up the first day of racing with a result good enough to gap second-placed Lacey Adams by 10.89 seconds. Winner of stage two, Lucile Metge, was significantly off the winning pace, losing 13.8 seconds to Porta. Ending the first day with another stage win, Hattie Harnden goes fastest again as besting race lead rival Ella Conolly by 1.743. In the short third stage, Harnden found 1.7 seconds to grow her lead against Conolly, who has not placed outside the top two across all three stages. Ending her day with a great result, first-year Elite Simona Kuchynkova finished stage three 2.8 back in third. After a puncture saw him place last on stage one, Jesse Melamed came back fighting with a stage victory to close out of tough day for the Canadian racer. Finishing a tiny fraction behind, Dimitri Tordo, who also flatted on stage one, ends his day 0.043 seconds back from the stage winner. Jack Moir couldn't quite manage a perfect first day, but with a third place and only losing 0.137 seconds, he will be very pleased with his performance so far in Pietra Ligure.

        "content": "Whistler Mountain Bike Park 2025 Season Opening Trail Report: PRESS RELEASE: Whistler Mountain Bike Park We couldn't be more excited as we gear up for the highly anticipated opening of the Whistler Mountain Bike Park season. Thanks to Mother Nature’s generous early-season conditions, the Fitzsimmons Zone is melting off beautifully while we wrap up the skiing and riding on Blackcomb. The energy of the park is back, and we can’t wait to see everyone on the trails. If you’re in the village, have a look up at the Joyride Crew hard at work in the Boneyard, preparing for the upcoming Crankworx festival scheduled for August 8th-17th. Before the big day arrives, be sure to give your bike a tune-up, get some rest, and remember: on opening day, it's all about the pre-ride, re-ride, and then free-ride. Can’t wait to see you out there. What's New This Season We're thrilled to introduce a few exciting new trails and features this summer: • Look out for a new access point to the top of Zone 2 A-Line and Ninja Cougar—coming soon! • An alternative exit for BCC trails in Creekside. • Upgraded wall rides on Crank It Up thanks to SRAM / Rockshox. • An extension of Pumpkin Moon. • Important Note: A physical pass will be required for entry this summer—don’t forget, the winter mobile pass function will not be valid. • We are thrilled that Commencal is joining us as a partner again this season with fresh new color bikes added to our rental fleet. Whistler Mountain Bike Park Passes and lift tickets are available for purchase . Crew Updates Our dedicated Bike Park team have been hard at work ensuring the park is in top condition for the season: • Many of our machine-built trails, including A-Line, South Park, Earth Circus, HOD, Crank It Up, and C-More, received facelifts last fall and are ready for action. • This spring, the crew has been busy raking off winter debris, clearing deadfall, and refreshing the winter rebuilds. • The Events Crew have been busy planning the Phat Wednesday and Phat Kidz Calendar, other special events, and Crankworx. It's all lining up to be a great summer of fun. Operational Plan for 2025 Season • Fitz Zone: May 16th - October 13th • Garbanzo Zone: June 14th - September 21st • Creekside Zone: June 7th - September 21st • Peak Zone / Top of the World: Open (TBD conditions) until September 1st Trail Report We anticipate some fantastic trail conditions for opening day—fingers crossed for a touch of moisture to keep the dirt nice and tacky. Most of the Fitzsimmons Zone will be open, with a few exceptions as noted below: • Dirt Merchant • Crabapple Hits • Rippin’ Rutabaga • Canadian Open (Lower) • Monkey Hands • A-Line (Zone 1) Check the WMBP's Trail Status page to see what's currently open before you ride. Please respect the trail closure signage. These closures are crucial for ensuring the safety of our crew while they complete their work and help extend the life of the trails throughout the season.

        "content": "Reimagined Courses & Stacked Athlete Fields Announced For Crankworx Cairns: PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx With just three weeks before some of the world’s best mountain bikers head to Cairns for the unofficial “Party Edition” of the Crankworx World Tour, May 21-25, the trails are shaping up to create the ultimate experience in mountain biking. With world-class fields and upgrades to the courses, it is looking to be another outstanding experience for athletes and fans on site or watching from home. A week of intense battles will be held against the picturesque backdrop of a tropical rainforest. Reimagined Courses For the last three decades, the iconic rainforest trails of Smithfield Mountain Bike Park have hosted some of the world’s biggest mountain bike competitions, including the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships and four iterations of Crankworx Cairns. The legacy will have a new chapter with innovation pushing the boundaries even further. A team of expert trail builders from World Trail and Flux Trail has been on course since early April, carefully crafting challenging and inspiring trails that will bring fans closer to the action. The introduction of Crankworx Full Tilt, a brand-new race format with three riders going head-to-head on a demanding new course, testing their speed and agility, has given the team freedom to design something new, giving the former Speed & Style course a new life. It’s built to a scale that will have some cool features and basically, depending on how game you are, will make you lead the race pretty much. The build definitely creates some fairly exciting racing. It’s full of fast knuckles, jumps and balance. Everything on the whole build is quite landscaped and rolled off, and it is built in a way that allows you to crisscross, turn and go in any direction of the trail. — Remy Morton, Director Flux Trail Additionally, the Official Australian Whip-Off Championships course has been reimagined and is set to see riders send bigger than ever. The new layout has kept the fans front of mind, opening up spectator areas right next to the action for an incredible viewing experience. This should just give a lot more spectator space and make for a much smaller and efficient push up for the riders, which will basically create a more action-packed event for both the rider and spectator. — Remy Morton, Director Flux Trail These exciting changes are all part of a much larger jigsaw puzzle which has enabled major improvements to the design for the Specialized Dual Slalom, concluding the festival on Sunday afternoon. Morton and the team including World Trial’s Glen Jacobs have utilised space saved from moving other courses to deliver huge upgrades to the Dual Slalom course, adding in plenty of corners from the previous straight heavy design. We have had the wall ride removed, we’ve added a bunch of rhythm sections and back-to-back s-bends in the bottom. It has quite a supercross inspiration going on, with on-offs and rollers and a fair bit of line choice and variations of how you can ride the rhythm sections. — Remy Morton, Director Flux Trail Last but definitely not least, the Crankworx Cairns Slopestyle course will see some significant revisions. The ‘Croc Tail’, ‘On/Off Switch’, and Quarterpipe will be retired, and a new jump line will be under construction. These updates will provide riders with an open canvas for more speed and air to showcase the best tricks in their arsenal. World Class Fields Course improvements and the new Crankworx Full Tilt event mean we will see one of the best rider fields ever assembled in Cairns. Crankworx Full Tilt Royal watching will be the name of the game in the first edition of Crankworx Full Tilt, with a battle royale expected with former Kings of Crankworx Sam Blenkinsop, Bas Van Steenbergen and Queen Caroline Buchanan, and current royalty Martha Gill and Ryan Gilchrist eyeing the title. Don’t count out multi-discipline athletes Niels Bensink, Tegan Cruz, Jayce Cunning, Jackson Frew, Mick Hannah, Charlie Makea, Bailey Meares, Sabina Košárková and Cassie Voysey, either, who will have their eyes on dethroning royalty in this new event, new to all riders. Crankworx Cairns Slopestyle Tickets to the Slopestyle competition are expected to be hot commodities with what might arguably be the most competitive field ever. Twelve of the world’s best riders will compete for the 2025 Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) title. 2024 champion David Godziek went on a rampage after winning last year, swiftly collecting two more golds, and is back and looking to defend his title. Godziek is returning from injury, as are fellow top riders Erik Fedko and Emil Johansson. Fresh from winning his first SWC gold at Crankworx Rotorua earlier this year, Tim Bringer, who had three podium finishes last year, will be looking to keep his roll of podiums running. Debuting last year, Alma Wiggberg claimed her first gold in Cairns before picking up silver in Innsbruck and another gold at Red Bull Joyride. After missing this year’s season kick-off in Rotorua due to injury, she will be eyeing a return to the top. Next to her on the rider list are Robin Goomes, a two-time gold medalist in last year’s Slopestyle World Championship and first female winner of Red Bull Rampage, and young talent Patricia Druwen, who claimed the top spot at the 2025 Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza at Crankworx Rotorua. Notably, all three women have emerged victorious in their first-ever SWC competitions, showing off their skills and fortitude. Aussie Watch In addition to Ryan Gilchrist and Caroline Buchanan, both vying for the royal title this year, there are plenty of Aussie names to watch on home soil. Jackson Frew, the runner-up in last year’s King of Crankworx standings, has kicked off his 2025 season strongly, winning the Crankworx Rotorua Pump Track Challenge in February. The Crankworx stalwart is a regular on the podium, and for fans wanting to watch tight and exciting battles in head-to-head disciplines, including Pump Track, Specialized Dual Slalom and Full Tilt, then he is a name to watch closely. Another rider who has been chasing the crown on the Crankworx World Tour for years is Cassie Voysey, looking to repeat her first Crankworx elite podium last year. Sian A’hern will be looking to shred it at the RockShox Downhill, and Cairns’ hometown hero Mick Hannah is returning once again to showcase his prowess on the local trails. Crankworx World Tour Standings With Crankworx Cairns hosting another round of the Dual Slalom, Pump Track, and Downhill Series, the race for the 2025 championship titles goes into the next phase – and current standings show that everything is possible. Ryan Gilchrist and Jenna Hastings lead the race to be crowned King and Queen of Crankworx, going into the Cairns festival, with multiple riders hot on their heels. See the current standings here . Get Involved The full event program is now online. Start planning your week to ensure you don’t miss the action.

        "content": "Get Your Fantasy Team on the Line Ahead of Round 1 - Bielsko-Biała World Cup DH 2025: We're back! It’s almost time to dust off the old armchair for some virtual team management. We’re excited to announce that Pinkbike's DH Fantasy League is coming back for 2025, presented by the good people at Five Ten. With a fictional budget of $1.5 million, you will choose your ultimate team of 6 riders (4 men, 2 women) and go to battle in the Pinkbike's DH Fantasy League. Show off your skills in choosing the best riders for all 10 rounds of the 2025 UCI World Cup, plus the 2025 UCI World Championships, and your team will score points based on how your riders perform. Dynamic Rider Pricing Back in action for another year, riders’ salaries will start the season based on their historical results and some insider insights, but those salaries will get updated after each round. Riders who are having a good season will rise in price over time, and riders who are struggling will drop in price. Fantasy team managers will have to be more savvy as the leading riders price themselves out of their teams. This will also help more divergent strategies emerge—will you field strong mid-pack riders, or will you go all-in on an expensive top rider? When rider prices change, if your team's budget gets pushed beyond the salary cap, your most expensive rider will be replaced with the least expensive rider. If your team is still over the budget cap, your next most expensive rider will be swapped for the least expensive rider. You can then choose to go and reallocate the budget and make changes as needed. Of course, players will still have time to update their teams to their preferences in the lead-up to each round of qualifiers—they’ll just need to stay under the $1.5 million cost cap. We’re excited for people to dig deeper into the field of riders, assess historical performances at specific venues, and overall fall further down the rabbit hole of DH nerding. Bragging rights are the most important part of Pinkbike's DH Fantasy League, and you can join up to 2 mini-leagues and compete against your friends. Each race round will have feature prizes, and then at the end of all 10 races, we crown the overall Fantasy Downhill Champion and present the Grand Prize! The League is open to everyone, but prizes are only available for contestants from the US, Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. Sounds good? Build your team today! Play Fantasy Downhill Now How to Play Prizes The League is open to everyone, but prizes are only available for contestants from the US, Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. If the top contestant is not from one of these countries, prizes will go to the next eligible person. Grand Prize / Season Overall At the end of the season, the overall Fantasy Downhill Champion will get a $5000 USD cash prize*. Yep, cold hard cash to spend on whatever you want. Should multiple teams have the same total cumulative points scores, the grand prize will be awarded to whoever scored the highest points in round race #1. See Official Rules for details. In addition to the Grand Prize, $5000 USD will be donated by Five Ten in honour of the Grand Prize winner to the Grow Cycling Foundation. See Official Rules for details. Round Prizes / Every World Cup + World Champs If you have the top team of the week, you'll take home 1 Pair of adidas Five Ten Freerider Pro BOA $180 USD + $200 USD of Adidas Five Ten Apparel. Each race round will have a prize for the Top Fantasy Team of that round. Should there be multiple teams with the same total points for that race round, the prize for that round will be awarded to whoever scores the highest points in the tiebreaker round. See Official Rules for details.

Filmed over multiple trips, covering LA, Copenhagen, and Barcelona, Bruno did have plans to finish things off with another stint in the US, but unfortunately due to his passport being stolen and some resulting ESTA issues, it wasn't to be. From the looks of the video, that extra trip wasn't even needed - Bruno killed it. Spot gold throughout, all handled with Bruno's ambidextrous tech powers. Enjoy 'Foreign.' Julián Molina - Welcome To Fit: How sick is Julián Molina? Amazing biker, incredible human... annnnnd the newest member of the Fit Familia! Julián is a 2X XGames RealBMX Fan Favourite, 3X Rumble in Richmond Best Trick/Biggest Roast winner, and the visionary behind Parabmxfreestyle (a program that spotlights physically challenged BMX Riders). Julián Molina - The Inspirational Story Of A One-Legged BMXer: Full of energy and determination, this is the inspirational story of BMX rider Julián Molina. After a collision with one of the local buses when he was younger, Julian Molina was left with a completely destroyed foot, which later became infected with gangrene, traumatically resulting in the amputation of his entire leg. Most would quit here, but not Julian. Despite his situation, the man has only looked forward and up, and two wheels has been his vehicle in that journey. Today he's stomping tricks he couldn't land with two legs, and riding with a bigger heart and smile than most. This is Julian Molina's story. Jamie Foy - Aftermath: How do you top the most dominant year of your life? Last year saw Jamie Foy deservedly re-scoop Thrasher’s Skater Of The Year award for a tour around the sun including but not limited to dropping back-to-back, era-defining video parts in the shape of New Balance’s ‘Intervals,’ Spitfire’s ‘Charred Remains,’ and Dickies’ ‘Honeymoon.’ The answer to where you go from the top is ‘Aftermath’: Jamie’s 2025 Red Bull Skateboarding part, a “victory lap” part that picks up in terms of progression and productivity, where his last year left off. Known as one of the biggest rail destroyers of skateboarding today, Jamie has walked the line to have the most indisputable pro career of the modern skateboarding era. Among the mayhem look out for some next-level ledge tech, and remind yourself each time that what you think is the ender isn’t the ender- because the stepping up just keeps coming! Ira Ingram and Kev Perez have done a sterling job in capturing a moment in time from a master of our craft at the peak of his powers. Jamie Foy’s rampage continues: this is Aftermath.

Kindred is the story of how one single leap-of-faith led Izzy and Zoya Lynch’s city-based family on the unlikely journey of becoming backcountry lodge owners, and resulted in a lifetime of learning and adventure in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.

I never thought I'd be in such a strange position, and I wasn't really sure how I felt about it. Made this video. Andrea: What pushes us farther in sport—in our passions? It’s a question that professional climber Nina Caprez and photographer Jeremy Bernard found themselves asking at the height of their careers, and just when they became parents. Believing that the value of sport comes through sharing it, they decided to create ANDREA—a non-profit that brings climbing to community. But when catastrophe strikes and forces them to pivot, the strength of ANDREA is tested. Follow along as they travel through Morocco, share their love of climbing, and find connection. Climbing Through When there always seems to be a tornado of obligation surrounding us, how do we commit to the moment and connect to the magic of now? Motherhood, guiding, her own counselling practice—professional climber Julia Niles has danced between responsibilities for years. Lured by her friend, pro athlete Em Pellerin, to go climb the big walls of Cochamó Valley, Chile, Julia relearns what it means to thrive. High off the deck, tied together, every action becomes a powerful reminder to slow down and embrace the present. And the experience becomes the fuel for what’s to come. Be Brave, Mom: \"What has definitely happened since becoming a parent is how much I appreciate going climbing and how much I treasure that time... I look at rock differently, how much time I have to climb differently... to now get to enjoy that with her is a gift I never expected.\" - Shauna Coxsey. To the moms who climb, carry, and keep showing up — Happy Mother's Day. Flashed—Babsi Zangerl's Historic Flash Of El Capitan: One try. That’s all it took for Babsi Zangerl to send the 3,000-foot Free Rider (VI 5.13a) on El Capitan. Setting off on a ground-up attempt this past November, Babsi and her partner Jacopo spent three days battling polished slabs, offwidths, and cryptic sequences on their historic bid. In the end, Babsi topped out as the first person to flash El Cap. But that’s just the “black and white” outcome of those fateful three days. What truly transpired was captured on film and tells a much deeper story—one of love, partnership, and character. This is the real story of Babsi and Jacopo’s epic ascent, laid bare for all to see. Harrison Roach - Bad Things Come In Three: Bad Things Come in Three is the latest example of Harrison Roach’s search for authenticity. In this creative short by Finlay Woods, we’re presented with his unique vision for surf-travel vis-à-vis surf-design.

Despite his low brow status as a bodyboarder, he feels right at home in an ocean full of surfers. Equipped with just a foam board and a pair of flippers, he charges the intimidating waves others shy away from. But unlike surfing, bodyboarding has few fans and even fewer sponsors. So to support himself, Shane works the mines. And while every dollar earned is spent on his next adventure, it’s a cost Shane happily pays to do what makes him feel most free. Director: Keith Malloy.

        "url": "https://www.pinkbike.com/news/sram-announces-cable-actuated-to-wireless-transmission-upgrade-kit.html",
        "content": "SRAM Announces Cable-Actuated to Wireless Transmission Upgrade Kit: Less than two months after launching their cable-actuated Eagle 90 and Eagle 70 drivetrains, SRAM has rolled out an upgrade kit for riders that want to convert a cable-actuated Transmission derailleur to a wireless one. The kit comes with a wireless derailleur body, a wireless shifter, battery, charger, and PowerLock quick link. The kit uses an existing Transmission 90 or 70 derailleur's lower cage and mounting bolt - it's the body of the derailleur that gets swapped out for a battery-operated one. Details • Compatible with Eagle 70 and Eagle 90 derailleurs • Includes derailleur body, battery, charger, and PowerLock • Price: $550 USD | €650 EU | £570 • sram.com Installation should be a fairly quick procedure, and it’s something most riders with a bit of mechanical know-how will be able to accomplish at home. Realistically, taking the old shifter, cable, and housing off a bike will probably take longer than converting the derailleur. \"Old\" probably isn't the most accurate word in this case, though, since Eagle 90 and 70 drivetrains have existed in the wild for a fairly short amount of time. I’m still running the Eagle 90 drivetrain I reviewed in March, and I'm not planning on converting it to wireless anytime soon - I really like having a bike that's fully battery free. That said, I don't mind that this kit exists, since it provides a less expensive upgrade pathway for riders that want to to ditch their cables and housing. While the $550 price tag of this kit is $126 less than you'd pay for all of the parts individually, it's also roughly the same price as a brand new Eagle 90 derailleur, cassette, chain, and chainring. At the end of the day, it all depends on whether you're on team wireless or team cable & housing. I doubt that SRAM will ever launch a ‘downgrade’ kit for converting wireless drivetains to cable-actuated, but I am curious if we’ll start seeing Eagle 90 derailleur bodies and shifters start show up on the Pinkbike BuySell . If that happens, battery averse riders who somehow ended up with wireless drivetrains will be able to go the other direction and add cables and housing back into their lives."

        "content": "Race Report: SloEnduro Round 1 in Nova Gorica: Words: SloEnduro Seven special stages on the rocks of Škabrijel, Skalnica and Sabotin mountains, a strong field and excellent organization of the TCS club at the opening round of the racing season in SloEnduro, the Slovenian enduro series. Let's say that the SloEnduro Day in Ajdovščina three weeks ago was at least an approximate preparation for what awaited the riders at the first round of the SloEnduro series this season. However, the conditions and the rules of the game were completely different in Nova Gorica on the western border of Slovenia. The first SloEnduro TCS Nova Gorica (Borderless Edition) served up a rocky, some of it steep, six stages on Škabrijel, Skalnica and Sabotin mountains on both banks of the Soča river with a total of around 1350 vertical metres of climbing on the full course. A few drops fell during the morning start from the Solkan Kayak Centre, but still the dust continued to make the stages slippery for most of the day. A beautiful but challenging route along the battlefields of the Soča Front in the First World War to start the 13th season of the SloEnduro series. The last test from Sabotin also made several switchbacks into Italy, justifying the title of \"borderless\" race and symbolically supporting the European Capital of Culture project GO! 2025 . In total, just over 280 riders from nine countries took part. The preparation of the course and the venue, as well as the overall organization of the TCS Association , which organized such an event for the first time (last year they hosted a SloEnduro Day), was excellent and set a high bar for the next organizers. New Era in Women's Racing, the Nežka Era? Nežka Libnik (KK Ravne na Koroškem), last year's U17 champion, won her first official race in the women's united category (junior, elite, masters) on the long course. Nežka, who had already competed on the long course in last year's final race with the permission of the series and won then too, won all six stages over the Soča river and won the race in just under 18 minutes ‘net’, with a one and a half minute advantage over second-placed Slovak rider Valentina Grendova (MTBiker) in second place and a minute and 53 seconds ahead of the third-placed Croatian Larisa Bošnjak (BBK Šišmiš). The top three (of course there are still five riders on the podium in SloEnduro) were followed by last year's national champion and overall SloEnduro winner Maša Komel (427 Savage Squad) in fourth and Germany's Silja Geck (Traction Development Racing) in fifth place. Four Countries on Men's Podium National Champion of Slovakia Luboš Staňo (MTBiker), fourth two years ago in Ajdovščina, came back even faster to take his first SloEnduro win. On his way to it, he won the first, third and last stages, winning the overall by five seconds from Hungarian junior Áron Babó (Rad Company Racing Team), already the most successful junior in the series last year and third overall in the final standings. Babó was fastest in the 4th and 5th stages of the day. In third place was another junior, Italian Simone Leo (Gencon Racing Team), 12 seconds behind the winner. Probably for the first time in the history of the series, there was only one Slovenian among the fastest five - the 2022 and 2023 SloEnduro winner Miha Smrdel (MBK Črni Vrh) finished in 4th place, 22 seconds behind the winner after winning the second stage of the day. Fifth place went to the second Slovak and Staň's teammate Maruš Krupa , 38 seconds behind. The Winners Said... My first official race in the women's category went well. I went to the start thinking 'I'll do it my way and then it will be what it will be'. The stages were nice, but quite dry, so it was quite slippery in some sections. But it was all made easier by the good company of the girls. — Nežka Libnik I did well. After the rain in the morning, it was like riding on ice in some parts of the first stage. I made a few mistakes, I didn't find the right speed, but I still won, and that gave me a boost for the next stages. The second and third went smoothly, but I liked the fourth one the best with the steep sections. There was something for me on each one. I hope to return to SloEnduro this year, maybe for the second round. It was the perfect start to the season for me. — Luboš Staňo In Long Course Categories So Áron Babó and Simone Leo finished at the top of the junior standings, while Ian Laharnar (Kamplc Racing Team), a newcomer to the category and last year's U17 champion, took third place. He was the 6th fastest overall. Six juniors finished in the top ten, which could be a preview of things to come in the season. Although last year's elite national champion and series champion, Vid Peršak, who missed the first round, will return to put things in order. Among the youngest veterans (master 1), Nejc Huth (Energijateam.com) won. He has been at the top of SloEnduro since the first season, and he also has one elite win from six years ago. Primož Štrancar (MBK Črni Vrh) took the win in master 2, and Austrian Michael Strohmayer (ASKÖ MK Factory Racing Team) in master 3. The fastest amateur of the day was Stefano Braidot (UC Caprivesi), but unfortunately, we don't get his brothers to the races anymore, as they are among the best in the world in XCO. It was also tense among the e-bikers, who had an extra ‘power stage’ stage uphill, short, but physically and technically demanding. Among the 16 participants, Jan Markič (Bradon Team), also by far the fastest in the ‘power’ stage, won the race, with Jaša Vodopivec in second place. Kristjan Medvešček, who won four of the seven stages but was slowed down by some technical issues at the end and finished in third place. On Shorter Courses The battle in the under-17 male category was fierce once again, with 49 riders taking part. Žiga Munih from the newly formed home team TCS Gravity took the initiative, and then Lenart Sever (KK Črn trn) won the second to the fifth and final stage, leading after the third and finally winning the race. Also in third, Hungary's Mátyás Csizmazia (Vesc Cycling Team) took second and stayed there until the end, Munih had to settle for third. The only U17 woman at the start was Lana Kuzma (KK Črn trn). In the U15 category, Tjaž Stres (Kamplc Racing Team) won over the three stages, losing only the second stage to his clubmate Rene Kovač, who was second in the end. Third place went to Erik Žgavc from the other Ajdovščina club, Črn trn. Matjaž Koron won the 4Fun promotional category on the same course. Vasilij Lavrenčič (KK Črn trn) won the U13 boys race on the shortest course, which consisted of two stages, while Lija Leber (427 Savage Squad) was the only girl at the start. Results Men 1st. Luboš STAŇO (SVK, MTBiker) — 15:19.46 2nd. Áron BABÓ (HUN, Rad Company Racing Team) — +5.58 3rd. Simone LEO (ITA, Gencon Racing Team) — +12.60 4th. Miha SMRDEL (SLO, MBK Črni Vrh) — +22.78 5th.

For the 10th anniversary, the Squamish Enduro team went all out to celebrate. A stacked field of local talent, riders from afar, and World Cup stars lined up at race start to tackle a loose and dusty track, atypical of April in Squamish. Under sunny skies, racers took on three distinct courses designed for a wide range of difficulty, spanning from intermediate all the way to expert (maybe even harder?), with 12 stages in total. The Classics Course emphasizes flow, with three stages spread across 25km. The updated Short (not-short) Course took athletes on a 35km loop through four stages of the best enduro race trails in the Squamish network. With two fresh in-stage trails, the Full Course riders smashed through five demanding stages over 45km and 1,800m of climbing. Classics Course riders had the ability to ride the course since registration day, with the intention of it being approachable and confidence-inspiring. Announced two weeks before race day, Short Course riders got to ride a fresh connector from Entrails to Roller Coaster, and a completely new trail in Nightshift, which came to life care of 500+ hours of volunteer time from a team of legendary (nocturnal) builders led by Matt Bolton. The Full Course gives riders 2 days to practice before the race, with the Ride Wrap Blind stage remaining unannounced until riders found it on course by following the marking arrows. Check out what practice looked like in the Instagram post below. In the early 2000s, the \"Rockstar presented by Tantalus Bike Shop\" was the showcase for Squamish freeride talent and ran for over a decade. In 2025, the Rockstar is reborn thanks to the Rawk & Route Project supported by Woodfibre LNG. The Rockstar on Cougar Ridge was the main spectator zone on the Full Course for 2025, where hundreds of roaring fans watched riders navigate multiple granite slabs at full speed. After a shuttle boost courtesy of The Shred Shuttle, riders found the Blind Stage as a rebuilt Upper Powersmart - a trail that has seen next to no traffic for the last 12 years, Also part of the Rawk & Route Project, and originally built in the late 90's by Rob Cocquyt, Upper Powersmart sits high up on Diamondhead, in some challenging trail building terrain. 300+ hours were put into resurrecting this classic. Full details about the Rawk & Route Project can be found on our website. Stay tuned for more on the Upper Powersmart build, coming soon. A huge thanks goes out to Anton Urtan, Matt Bolton, Jordan Graves, and the entire crew who put nearly 700 hours of contracted trail work into the course for 2025, and pushed through a wet and cold winter/early spring to get it done. Supported by our Official Trail Partners, Matthews West Developments and Kiewit, as well as Fortisbc and Surerus Murphy Joint Venture, these build and maintenance efforts are assets that the community can enjoy for years to come. SHORT COURSE Even the spectators were elite. Get a dog in ya! CLASSICS COURSE FULL COURSE - Winners of the Speed Zone on the Full Course took home their speed in Limited Edition Howe Sound Brewing tall cans. A field of Canadian pros from the World Cup EDR circuit duked it out on Sunday, but in the end, it was the battle of the sleeves with Lief caught in the middle. Canadian and US National Champions Jesse Melamed and Richie Rude had the young gun Lief Rodgers keeping the pressure on. Jesse took stages 1 & 2, with Richie taking the win on 3. Lief captured stage 4 and hung on for a second-place finish, but consistency prevailed, and Melamed took home stage 5 and his fifth title as Squamish Enduro champ. The youth movement was on pace to kick off the day in the Pro Women's field, with 15-year-old Ruby Wells taking the win on stage 1, and Elly Hoskin taking stage 2. Solid and steady, Andréane Lanthier Nadeau hung in, with a second-place finish on the first two stages, and pulled ahead with wins on stages three through five, to capture her third Squamish Enduro overall victory. The race was really good! The young ones were really close... but experience pays off today! — Andréane Lanthier Nadeau - COMMENCAL / 7 MESH Man, it was amazing! I think I've said this every year - it was one of the best courses we've ever had. They do such a good job of revamping old trails, so it was so sweet to go race some trails I've never ridden before and have such a good time.” — Jesse Melamed - Canyon CLLCTV COMPLETE RESULTS Between cash contributions, donations from registrants, and the SORCA raffle at our apres supported by our sponsors we raised $16,000 for SORCA at this years event. On top of that we funded over $25,000 of trail work and had Fortis and Surerus Murphy Joint Venture work with us to contribute over $30,000 of contract labour into a rebuild on Hoods in the Woods for the Classics Course. Huge thanks to all of the participants,100+ volunteers, Zone 4 for their flawless timing, our amazing sponsors, and the support team that comes together to make the Squamish Enduro a reality.

        "content": "Say Farewell to the Legendary 7-Day BC Bike Race in 2025 & 2026: 2026 marks 20 years of The Ultimate Singletrack Experience — and the last chance to ride the iconic 7-day format North Vancouver, BC — April 8, 2025 — The iconic BC Bike Race (BCBR) is turning 20, and we’re marking the moment with a celebration for the ages. The 2026 edition of The Ultimate Singletrack Experience will be part farewell tour, part family reunion — and the final chance to take on the legendary 7-day format that helped define mountain bike stage racing in North America. Since 2007, BCBR has led the way in stage racing innovation. While other events chased mileage, we built something different: a celebration of singletrack. World-class trails, a vibrant community, and a rider-first experience brought mountain bikers from around the world to British Columbia. More than a race, BCBR became a rite of passage— a journey that tests your body, fuels your soul, and earns you a belt buckle that says: I did it! This is more than a milestone — it’s a moment—twenty years of dirt, sweat, and memories. We’ve watched friendships form, families grow, and racers return again and again. For us and for many of our racers, those seven days in the summer feel like a family gathering. — Andreas Hestler, BCBR Co-Founder The Evolution Continues After 2026, BCBR will evolve into a new format — but the spirit of the race remains: rider-focused, community-driven, and unapologetically singletrack-obsessed. Bikes have evolved. Trails have evolved. Riders have evolved — and so have we. We’re proud to lead the next evolution of stage racing. But before we turn the page, we’re inviting everyone to help us close this chapter in style. — Dean Payne, BCBR Co-Founder and President Final Chance to Ride the Classic The 2025 and 2026 editions will be your last chance to ride the full 7-day BCBR format. If you’ve ever dreamed of crossing that Day 7 finish line, now is the time. An important change for the 2026 race is the dates. Next year, the race will run from May 23-29, offering prime trail conditions and cooler temperatures (around 18°C/60°F). Registration for the 2025 race —June 30- July 6 on Vancouver Island—is open, and you still have time to organize your logistics and train your body. Start putting those miles in now, and then drop into our free 6-week training program led by Mad Endurance starting on May 12. Designed to prepare you for 7 days on a bike, this program will set you up for success right before the race starts. Riders can expect all the classic BCBR ingredients: world-class singletrack, stunning West Coast scenery, an unmatched race community, and a week of adventure that riders will remember for a lifetime. They can also expect some serious celebrations to mark the race’s 20-year milestone, including one heck of a party at the end. Alumni & Early Access Registration BCBR alumni will have the first opportunity to secure a spot for 2026 during our exclusive: • Alumni Priority Window: Opens May 1 • Early Access List: Opens May 7 • General Registration: Opens May 15 Don’t miss your chance to be part of the final moments of this BCBR chapter.

        "content": "Must Watch: Billy Spurway’s Full-Throttle, Loose-as-You-Like New Zealand Mix: I’ve been keeping tabs on Billy Spurway for a while now — his riding’s always had this raw energy to it, but his latest edit with Ripton cranks it up another level. The new video, shot by Tom Booker, just dropped, and it’s a blur of speed, style, and that unfiltered freeride vibe that gets me so fired up to go riding. Billy spent the winter digging and riding in New Zealand, and it shows. Big hits, fast lines, and no shortage of commitment. He blends moto-style speed with that skate-inspired looseness — nose bonks, wild tables, and a death-grip riding style that feels just barely on the edge of control in the best way possible. This is Billy’s first official edit for Ripton , the denim-forward brand that’s been popping up more and more in MTB, and the partnership makes sense. Like Billy, they’re not trying to fit the mold — baggy fits, streetwear aesthetics, and an obvious nod to BMX and skate culture run through the whole piece. If you’re into freeride edits that don’t feel over-polished or overly choreographed, this one’s worth a watch. Spurway's doing his own thing — and it's damn fun to see. Photos and video by Tom Booker. Additional filming by Scott Robb, Harry Little, and Quentin Delbergue."

Sharing the bad news, Kerr said he \"still can't believe what has happened\" after making \"so many sacrifices going into a season with one purpose of putting everything into performing my absolute best.\" In the social media post Kerr said the crash resulted in a broken left wrist and right hand. As I sit here writing this I still can't believe what has happened…my only positive thoughts are that I'm gonna be okay and life moves on, it could be a lot worse… Yesterday myself and Ryan Griffith had the identical crash about 20 seconds apart…. I’m a bit speechless and just so upset and disappointed for us both…go give him some love as his was a hugey! I’ve personally never been so focused, worked so hard and made so many sacrifices going into a season with one purpose of putting everything into performing my absolute best… I’ve honestly never felt better. There’s a Full video on YouTube, but unfortunately, I have broken my left wrist and my right hand… I still can't believe I can’t just turn back time and do it again… I’m heartbroken more than I knew before… but like I say, I know we will be able to come back from this. Thank you so much to all our sponsors and fans and just everyone that supports us and wills us on…this is not the end just a slight setback. — Bernard Kerr Kerr's Pivot Factory Racing teammate Ryan Griffith also crashed in the same spot and was knocked out for 40 seconds after the impact. Griffith has shared an update on social media, saying he has been fixed up in surgery and hopes it will be a quick recovery. I had a bit of a freak accident yesterday. It was the last lap of the day. Me and Bernard Kerr both crashed in the exact same spot about 20 seconds apart. I was knocked out for a good 40 seconds, but got pretty lucky for the most part. A plastic surgeon fixed me up for 3 hours last night so looking a bit better haha. Really bummed but hopefully this will be a quick recovery and can get racing soon! Healing vibes to Bernard Kerr, that was a rough day for us both. Thank you to everyone who helped me get off that hill yesterday. We’ll be back in no time. — Ryan Griffith We wish Bernard Kerr and Ryan Griffith all the best with their recovery and hope they are back racing soon."

        "content": "Race Day Photo Epic: Pietra Ligure Enduro World Cup 2025: PHOTO EPIC 2025 Enduro World Cup LET'S GO RACING Pietra Ligure, Italy Photography by Dave Trumpore Words by Ed Spratt Pietra Ligure has delivered some incredible racing to kick off the 2025 Enduro World Cup series, showcasing two days of racing with a total distance of around 100 kilometres, including liaisons. After seven timed stages, we have the final results from Italy. In the Junior Men's racing, Melvin Almueis took the lead on stage one and never left the top position. Picking up two stage wins on his way to the round one victory, Almueis faced challengers across each stage, but he still ended the weekend with a lead of 14 seconds against Millwood Cooper. Completing the overall top three and the only rider within a minute of Almueis, Italian racer Matteo Falcini secured a great result on home soil. The Junior Women's race produced another French victor as Lucile Metge finished the two racing days with a lead of almost two minutes. Metge faced a close battle with Elise Porta until the final stage, where Porta took a DNF. With a DNF for Porta, Lacey Adams stepped into the second-place spot, with Yeti teammate Chloe Bear in third. After winning five of the seven stages, Hattie Harnden wins the Elite Women's Pietra Ligure World Cup. While Harnden is focusing on Downhill this season, she proved this weekend that she is still the one to beat in the longer-format gravity World Cup discipline. Ending the two days 24 seconds back, Ella Conolly had a great ride to kick off the season and will be one to watch for the overall title, with Harnden absent for most of this year's events. Morgane Charre took the final podium spot and was the only other rider within a minute of Harnden. In a close battle for the race win, the final stage decided the victory in the Elite Men's racing. After showing consistency across all seven stages, Dan Booker wins in Pietra Ligure, fighting off Slawomir Lukasik in the final moments. With just 0.374 seconds splitting the leading pair after 43 minutes of racing, it was incredibly close between the leading racers. Ending his weekend in third, World Champ Alex Rudeau also had a great start to the 2025 series. Riders don't have long to rest after four big back-to-back days of practice and racing, as they will now head to Poland for the series' second stop in Bielsko-Biała. It's nice to have a World Cup somewhere a little more unique than the Alps 1000m mountains on one side of town, and the Mediterranean Sea on the other. As you do when in Italy Bikes of all kinds everywhere you look Lief Rogers keeping the liaisons fun It's good to see a rainbow jersey in Enduro after so many seasons. And a 3rd for Alex Rudeau would be a good way for the World Champ to kick off the season S1 was in a mood to kick of the day Chloe Taylor on S3 Being a mechanic on the Enduro circuit is no easy feat. Trying to keep up with the best riders in the world during practice can have its consequences Pietra Ligure. Just down the road from the classic venue of Finale Halfway down S1 was the only time all weekend that riders were not deep in the woods Local legend Tommaso Francardo in 14th Charlie Murray pushing on day 2 to make up time Marco Osborne in 24th Big days are back in Enduro and the riders are loving it Just stuffing bags and pockets with a few snacks for a 5-hour day on the bike Dan Booker showing everyone who's boss on flat pedals Ella Conolly took home 2nd in Elite Women, and with winner Harriet Harnden focusing on DH the remainder of the year, she'll have her sights set on the series lead next week in Poland Chloe Bear on Stage 5 Eddie Masters gave it a go after recovering from surgery and a broken elbow, but would have to call it quits on day 2 Estelle Charles going the privateer route this season Sławomir Lukasik though the fog up high on S1 It was heartbreaking to watch Jesse Melamed's race effectively end with a flat tire. A whole offseason of preparation undone on the very first stage of the year. World Champ Alex Rudeau on his way to 3rd Jesse Melamed in training on the first long day of practice Not dry Dusty one minute, muddy the next on day 1 Sharp rocks litter every trial in Pietra and Finale, taking no mercy on riders' tires and rims Morgane Charre on S2 Junior Women's winner Lucile Metge Harriet Harnden on a belt-driven gear box bike with Manitou suspension wins the opening Enduro World Cup of 2025 in Pietra Ligure, Italy Christian Textor on S3 1st in Jr. Men would be Melvin Almueis Speed Tarmo Ryynanen in lucky 13th A breakout performance for Winni Goldsbury in 7th 6th for Andreane Lanthier Nadeau Just off the podium in 4th for Raphaela Richter George Swift came 15th in Elite Women Ryan Gilchrist charging in the rain on day 1 A gear box and a belt drive raced to the top of an Enduro World Cup podium for the very first time Gearboxes and belt drives in the women's field, prototype inverted forks in the men's, and flat pedals on the podium in both.  Enduro really is a mixed bag of technologies, with no right answer as to what will perform Simona Kuchynkova would take 8th in her first Elite Women's race 3rd for Morgane Charre Evan Wall back in the mix with a 19th JT Fischer rounded out the top 10 in his first elite race 5th for Ryan Gilchrist with his eyes mostly closed Jack Moir dominated day 1 but would have a huge crash to start the 2nd day, eventually finishing in 4th Hanna Steinthaler not looking very amused at the rain storm that materialised out of the blue on Day 1 6th for Richie Rude, who will be turning his attention to DH the remainder of the season Charlie Murray had high expectations this weekend but would have to settle for 11th William Brodie would take a career best 8th Quietly flying under the radar while putting the hurt to everyone else in the Elite Men's Field, Dan Booker took a well-deserved first win 12th for Greg Callaghan A hard-charging Slawomir Lukasik led after stage 6 but would slip back to second by the smallest of margins on the final stage of the day Lucile Metge took top honours in Jr. Women ahead of Lacey Adams and Chloe Bear Melvin Almueis, Cooper Millwood, and Matteo Falcini were top three in Jr. Men Harriet Harnden topped Ellla Conolly and Morgane Charre in Elite Women Dan Booker, Slawomir Lukasik, and Alex Rudeau on top in Elite Men after almost 45 minutes of racing Team of the day went to Yeti, which was no surprise after putting 4 riders inside the top 10 of the Elite Men's field and taking two podium spots in Jr. Women"
