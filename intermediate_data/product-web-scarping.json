If you find yourself at a height in which you can fit 2 different frame sizes, ask yourself what your riding style is like and where/how you intend to use the bike. A larger frame will feel more stable at high speeds, but not as maneuverable in tighter and more technical situations on the trail. Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - Should I get a Hayduke or a Japhy?\nHow do you ride?\nThe Japhy is an everything trail bike - its your night ride bike, its your durable hardtail, and it can even do an overnighter once in while. The geometry is designed to be a bit more stable at high speeds, wheelie and bunnyhop easier, and lower your center of gravity by not only using a smaller front triangle and lower standover height, but a lower bottom bracket to get your feet a little closer to the ground. It also has a steeper seat tube angle than the Hayduke, making it much more enjoyable for seated climbs, and a little less forgiving on flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nThe Hayduke is a more dedicated bikepacking bike made to take more gear. It has more front triangle space, more neutral geometry for hauling a load, and more places to mount gear. It also has a more relaxed seat tube angle than the Japhy, which makes it more comfortable for flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nIf you carry gear 10% of the time, and mostly just want an awesome riding hardtail that you can depend on, get the Japhy. If you carry gear more than 50% of the time, and wanted a more dedicated bike for that purpose, get the Hayduke.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Hayduke carry?\nSM\n= 1 bottle in the front traingle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nMD/LG/XL\n= 2 bottles in the front traingle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nQ - Can I put a rear rack on the Hayduke?\nSure Thing! Our Hayduke model has dedicated multiple rack mounts built into the frame, or you can utilize a rear rack by installing our\nPortage Rack Mount Bolts\nand a\nSeatpost Clamp with Rack Mounts\n.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Hayduke?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. Heck, we even have a single speed build option that you can buy!\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Hayduke?\nTechnically, yes, but we recommend working with your favorite professional mechanic to figure out which hubs and support parts may be needed. Have fun!\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not. We offer a limited menu of upgrade options for all of our bikes, but we do not do custom builds.\nIf you'd like to have a custom Esker built up, please reach out to one of our\nRetail Partners\nand they'll work with you on getting you exactly what you want!\nQ - Do your steel frames ride different than your Titanium frames?\nYes and No. Based on our own riding input, as well as a ton of great input and feedback from our customers, find that our steel frames have a very similar feel when it comes to compliance on the trail in comparison with our Titanium frames. The biggest difference that most individuals feel is the weight savings of Titanium. Our Titanium frames are around 650-900grams lighter than their steel counterparts. This weight savings results in a 'snappier' and more 'lively' riding characteristic when on the trail.\nQ - Do I need to 'Frame-Saver' your steel frames after I buy one?\nNOPE! We treat all of our steel frames with an Electrophoretic Deposition (ED) coating inside and out prior to painting them for rust protection.\nQ - What does your warranty look like?\nClick here for warranty information\nQ - Can I order one of your frames/bikes through a local bike shop?\nAbsolutely. That would be the best way to order one of our frames/bikes! Working with your local bike shop allows you to get great insight on which model is right for you, which size may work best for your intended use, and ensure that your bike gets built up and fit to your exact specifications. Jump on over to our\nDealer Locator\nto see a full map of our retail partners and find the one closest to you.\nQ - Can I demo a bike before I buy it?\nWe do our best to travel around throughout the year and often partner with regional mountain bike festivals or local retail partners to host demos. For the most up to date opportunities, check our\nDealer Locator.\nYou can also see a full map of our retail partners - reach out to them if you're near by and ask them what they may have available for you to demo locally.\nQ - I want to buy a frame bag before my bike/frame arrives to me, can you provide the frame bag dimensions for the Hayduke?\nWe don't recommend buying a frame bag until you have your frame/bike on hand. That is absolute best way to ensure you get the right size and shape for your bike.\nIf you're looking to make a custom bag(s) for your Esker, we've partnered with some incredible custom frame bag makers that all have our frame dimensions and files on hand. Please reach out to one of the following frame bag makers to get the exact bags made for your bike that you want!\nCadaero\n- Two Harbors, Minnesota\nJPaks LLC\n- Denver, Colorado\nRogue Panda\n- Flagstaff, Arizona\nRockgeist\n- Ashville, North Carolina\nBUILT FOR THE BACKCOUNTRY\nWe here at Esker enjoy long rides into the wild spaces and are proud to say our bikes are truly\nBuilt for the Backcountry\n. That means they are designed and built on three values:\nREFINED GEOMETRY\nSpecific geometry to suit the riders needs for each different model, we have designed and developed a quick and responsive ride quality for all Esker models. Our geometries are refined, stable, and comfortable to provide a bike that always feels right at home.\nDURABILITY\nWe build our bicycles with the highest quality metal tubing for the utmost in durability.\nEach tubeset provides a greater strength to weight ratio than other frames on the market and engineered specifically for its application. Every Esker frame is tested to our own internal standard far exceeding ISO 4210, for a true lifetime of constant use. Esker will get you into the backcountry as far as you want to go, but it will also get you back!\nRIDE QUALITY\nNot too flexy, not too stiff…but just right! We are riders, and design our bikes by riding them, constantly, to refine the perfect feel. We toil over every model to ensure the ride simply feels right and comfortable, like your favorite hoody\nAbout\nContact\nAdvocacy\nJobs\nFAQ\nTech Documents\nRegistration\nWarranty\nReturns and Cancellations\nTerms of Service\nB2B Login\nRIDE WITH US\nSign up to our mailing list\nSubscribe\n© 2025,\nEsker Cycles\nPayment methods\nAmerican Express\nApple Pay\nDiners Club\nDiscover\nGoogle Pay\nMastercard\nShop Pay\nVisa\nSearch"

The shorter travel sibling to Woodsy. Built with long rides in mind, the Howdy can get up over and down anywhere you can think to pedal it. Don’t be fooled by the modest 125mm of travel, this peppy trail bike can handle it all.\nThe Howdy boasts a durable aluminum frame that instils confidence on every ride.

The shorter travel sibling to Woodsy Ti. Built with long rides in mind, the Howdy Ti can get up over and down anywhere you can think to pedal it. Don’t be fooled by the modest 125mm of travel, this peppy trail bike can handle it all.\nWhy titanium? Why not? We are lovers of all things bike and once we made an alloy full suspension bike, it was only logical to also make an elegant titanium front triangle as well. We took everything we’ve learned from years of making hardtails and used it to create a great riding (and great looking) titanium full suspension bike.\nThe magic happens when the Ti it is combined with an alloy rear triangle via an eye catching bottom bracket cluster.\nWHAT'S IN A NAME?\nNamed after the \"Good Outdoor Manners Raccoon.\" of the mid-twentieth century US Forest Service campaign.

If you find yourself at a height in which you can fit 2 different frame sizes, ask yourself what your riding style is like and where/how you intend to use the bike. A larger frame will feel more stable at high speeds, but not as maneuverable in tighter and more technical situations on the trail. Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - Should I get a Hayduke or a Japhy?\nHow do you ride?\nThe Japhy is an everything trail bike - its your night ride bike, its your durable hardtail, and it can even do an overnighter once in while. The geometry is designed to be a bit more stable at high speeds, wheelie and bunnyhop easier, and lower your center of gravity by not only using a smaller front triangle and lower standover height, but a lower bottom bracket to get your feet a little closer to the ground. It also has a steeper seat tube angle than the Hayduke, making it much more enjoyable for seated climbs, and a little less forgiving on flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nThe Hayduke is a more dedicated bikepacking bike made to take more gear. It has more front triangle space, more neutral geometry for hauling a load, and more places to mount gear. It also has a more relaxed seat tube angle than the Japhy, which makes it more comfortable for flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nIf you carry gear 10% of the time, and mostly just want an awesome riding hardtail that you can depend on, get the Japhy. If you carry gear more than 50% of the time, and wanted a more dedicated bike for that purpose, get the Hayduke.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Japhy carry?\nSM\n= 1 bottle in the front traingle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nMD/LG/XL\n= 2 bottles in the front traingle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nQ - What length dropper comes with a complete build?\nSM\n= 150mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 125mm of travel.\nMD/LG/XL\n= 170mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 145mm of travel\nFor more information on the adjustability of the PNW Loam dropper, click\nHERE\n.\nQ - Can I put a rear rack on the Japhy?\nSure Thing! You can utilize a rear rack by installing our\nPortage Rack Mount Bolts\nand a\nSeatpost Clamp with Rack Mounts\n.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Japhy?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. Heck, we even have a single speed build option that you can buy!\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Japhy?\nTechnically, yes, but we recommend working with your favorite professional mechanic to figure out which hubs and support parts may be needed. Have fun!\nQ - How does the Portage Dropout System work?\nThe\nPortage Dropout System\nattaches to our hardtail frames and allows you to adjust chainstay length (for ride characteristics or tire width clearances), chain tension (for single speed application), or different hanger types (\nUDH\nor\nClassic\n).\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not. We offer a limited menu of upgrade options for all of our bikes, but we do not do custom builds.\nIf you'd like to have a custom Esker built up, please reach out to one of our\nRetail Partners\nand they'll work with you on getting you exactly what you want!\nQ - Do your steel frames ride different than your Titanium frames?\nYes and No. Based on our own riding input, as well as a ton of great input and feedback from our customers, find that our steel frames have a very similar feel when it comes to compliance on the trail in comparison with our Titanium frames. The biggest difference that most individuals feel is the weight savings of Titanium. Our Titanium frames are around 650-900grams lighter than their steel counterparts. This weight savings results in a 'snappier' and more 'lively' riding characteristic when on the trail.\nQ - Do I need to 'Frame-Saver' your steel frames after I buy one?\nNOPE! We treat all of our steel frames with an Electrophoretic Deposition (ED) coating inside and out prior to painting them for rust protection.\nQ - What does your warranty look like?\nClick here for warranty information\nQ - Can I order one of your frames/bikes through a local bike shop?\nAbsolutely. That would be the best way to order one of our frames/bikes! Working with your local bike shop allows you to get great insight on which model is right for you, which size may work best for your intended use, and ensure that your bike gets built up and fit to your exact specifications.

If you find yourself at a height in which you can fit 2 different frame sizes, ask yourself what your riding style is like and where/how you intend to use the bike. A larger frame will feel more stable at high speeds, but not as maneuverable in tighter and more technical situations on the trail. Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - Should I get a Hayduke or a Japhy?\nHow do you ride?\nThe Japhy is an everything trail bike - its your night ride bike, its your durable hardtail, and it can even do an overnighter once in while. The geometry is designed to be a bit more stable at high speeds, wheelie and bunnyhop easier, and lower your center of gravity by not only using a smaller front triangle and lower standover height, but a lower bottom bracket to get your feet a little closer to the ground. It also has a steeper seat tube angle than the Hayduke, making it much more enjoyable for seated climbs, and a little less forgiving on flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nThe Hayduke is a more dedicated bikepacking bike made to take more gear. It has more front triangle space, more neutral geometry for hauling a load, and more places to mount gear. It also has a more relaxed seat tube angle than the Japhy, which makes it more comfortable for flatter, more pedaling based rides.\nIf you carry gear 10% of the time, and mostly just want an awesome riding hardtail that you can depend on, get the Japhy. If you carry gear more than 50% of the time, and wanted a more dedicated bike for that purpose, get the Hayduke.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Japhy Titanium carry?\nSM/MD/LG/XL\n= 2 bottles in the front traingle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nQ - Can I put a rear rack on the Japhy Titanium?\nSure Thing! You can utilize a rear rack by installing our\nPortage Rack Mount Bolts\nand a\nSeatpost Clamp with Rack Mounts\n.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Japhy Titanium?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. Heck, we even have a single speed build option that you can buy!\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Japhy Titanium?\nTechnically, yes, but we recommend working with your favorite professional mechanic to figure out which hubs and support parts may be needed. Have fun!\nQ - How does the Portage Dropout System work?\nThe\nPortage Dropout System\nattaches to our hardtail frames and allows you to adjust chainstay length (for ride characteristics or tire width clearances), chain tension (for single speed application), or different hanger types (\nUDH\nor\nClassic\n).\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not. We offer a limited menu of upgrade options for all of our bikes, but we do not do custom builds.\nIf you'd like to have a custom Esker built up, please reach out to one of our\nRetail Partners\nand they'll work with you on getting you exactly what you want!\nQ - Do your steel frames ride different than your Titanium frames?\nYes and No. Based on our own riding input, as well as a ton of great input and feedback from our customers, find that our steel frames have a very similar feel when it comes to compliance on the trail in comparison with our Titanium frames. The biggest difference that most individuals feel is the weight savings of Titanium. Our Titanium frames are around 650-900grams lighter than their steel counterparts. This weight savings results in a 'snappier' and more 'lively' riding characteristic when on the trail.\nQ - What does your warranty look like?\nClick here for warranty information\nQ - Can I order one of your frames/bikes through a local bike shop?\nAbsolutely. That would be the best way to order one of our frames/bikes!

If you find yourself at a height in which you can fit 2 different frame sizes, ask yourself what your riding style is like and where/how you intend to use the bike. A larger frame will feel more stable at high speeds, but not as maneuverable in tighter and more technical situations on the trail. Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - Didn’t Esker make a Lorax before?\nWe DID! Many of you know that the Lorax has been with us as a company for a long time…even prior to Esker as a brand. In the past, this bike has fit into the ‘Gravel Road’ category with a more traditional drop-bar geometry and use case. While the new Lorax will indeed boast drop-bars like the previous generations we’ve come to know and love, the similarities end there. We took a look at the Lorax and asked ourselves, “What would our ideal drop-bar bike look like?” and “Where do we intend to ride it?”. Those questions inspired visions of touring high alpine forest roads, back roads of the Northwoods, and jumping on secret strips of singletrack while we link together routes in our local communities.The Lorax finds its final form as a ‘Drop-Bar Mountain Bike’ built for touring, exploring, and whatever silly shenanigans you want to put it through. Scroll through the questions below for more information the Lorax.\nQ - Can I use a front derailleur on the Lorax?\nTechnically, yes, we designed the Lorax to clear the space a front derailleur occupies and clearance for compact double cranks, but unfortunately there is no 'out-of-the-box' option that works with the Lorax's chainline and tire clearances. The Lorax is designed with 1X drivetrains as the priority and while there are a handful of 2X options that could technically work, they require deviations from their originally intended design (adapters, odd pull ratios, etc). If you would like to expiriment with those setups, feel free, but make sure you've got a lot of patience and know a great mechanic. Have fun!\nQ - Can I build the Lorax with a Flatbar?\nSure thing! If your fit or intended use of the bike requires a very short reach and taller stack, a Flatbar Lorax could be an amazing option. We could even ship the Lorax with a standard post-mount dropout to make things easier for your build. Just shoot us an email at\ninfo@eskercycles.com\nand we’d be happy to work with you on it.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Lorax carry?\nSM = 1 bottle in the front triangle, 1 bottle under the downtube.\nMD/LG/XL = 2 bottles in the front triangle, 1 bottle under the down tube.\nQ - Can I put a rear rack on the Lorax?\nHeck yeah! The Lorax has integrated rear rack mounts on the seatstay.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Lorax?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. However, in its standard configuration, the Lorax utilizes a Flat-Mount Portage dropout that is not adjustable. If you would like the ability to adjust chain tension or play with tire clearance and chainstay length, you will need to utilize our Adjustable UDH Dropouts. These dropouts run a post-mount brake standard and are only available when ordering a frame (not a complete bike). If you would like this option, simply email us at\ninfo@eskercycles.com\nwhen placing your Lorax frame order and we’ll make sure it ships with the Adjustable UDH Dropouts.\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Lorax?\nTechnically, yes, but we don't offer any support on figuring out which hubs and support parts may be needed in order to make this happen. Have fun!\nQ - What is the ‘Bolt Setback’ of the top-tube mounts?\nThe Lorax uses a 124mm setback for the top-tube mounts. This allows for more room while using multiple cockpit bags (TT, Feedbags, etc), as well as helping to eliminate stem/steering interference. All of our bag manufacturing partners offer this setback option along with various mass-production options from other brands.\nCadaero\n- Two Harbors, Minnesota\nJPaks LLC\n- Denver, Colorado\nRogue Panda\n- Flagstaff, Arizona\nRockgeist\n- Asheville, North Carolina\nQ - How does the Portage Dropout System work?\nThe Portage Dropout System attaches to our hardtail frames and allows you to adjust chainstay length (for ride characteristics or tire width clearances) and chain tension (for single speed application).\nNOTE:\nThe Lorax utilizes a Flat-Mount Portage dropout that is compatible with most modern drop-bar hydraulic brake options and is not adjustable. If you would like the ability to adjust chain tension or play with tire clearance and chainstay length, you will need to utilize our Adjustable UDH Dropouts. These dropouts run a post-mount brake standard and are only available when ordering a frame (not a complete bike). If you would like this option, simply email us at\ninfo@eskercycles.com\nwhen placing your Lorax frame order and we’ll make sure it ships with the Adjustable UDH Dropouts.\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not.

We like to imagine that if that legendary bear from our youth rode a mountain bike, this would be the one. The Smokey is longer, lower, and slacker than any bike we have ever made and it is the perfect tool for exploration when the backcountry gets rowdy.\nBIG TRAVEL FOR BIG RIDES\nThe Smokey may be the most aggressive frame we have ever made, but it still has all the values that make it an Esker.\nPrioritizing durability and ease of maintenance, the Smokey has external cable routing, threaded bottom bracket and a 44mm head tube. The Smokey boasts four different water bottle and accessory mounting positions, including a 3-pack mount on the downtube for when you need a little extra carrying capacity.\nFEATURE PACKED\n29\"\nWheels\nClearance\nup to a 2.6\" tire\n160mm\nTravel Fork\nCustom Tubing\n- seamless, double-butted, tapered, Drawn Over Mandrel, size-specific, ED Coated, 4130 Chromoly\nPortage Dropout\n- for adjustability, singlespeed and upgradeability.\nUDH\nCompatible\nUSE THE CODE\nSPRINGSMOKEYSALE\nAT CHECKOUT FOR 20% OFF YOUR SMOKEY ORDER (FRAMES AND COMPLETES) - ENDS MAY 31ST\nDesign & Order your Smokey\nGEARED COMPLETE\nStarting at $3,000 - Click to Configure\nSINGLE SPEED COMPLETE\nStarting at $2,700 - Click to Configure\nFRAME/FORK\nStarting at $1,000 - Click to Configure\nGeometry\nS1/SM\nS2/MD\nS3/LG\nS4/XL\nEffective TT Length\n571\n608\n639\n679\nReach\n441\n473\n501\n531\nStack\n612\n622\n646\n688\nHT Angle\n64.5*\n64.5*\n64.5*\n64.5*\nHT Length\n90\n100\n127\n174\nEffective ST Angle\n77*\n77*\n77*\n77*\nST Length\n375\n410\n440\n475\nMax Seat Tube Insertion\n225\n260\n290\n325\nChainstay Length\n440-454\n440-454\n440-454\n440-454\nFork Offset\n44\n44\n44\n44\nFork Length\n530\n530\n530\n530\nBB Drop\n60\n60\n60\n60\nMax Seatpost Insertion\n195\n190\n240\n290\nWheelbase\n1178\n1217\n1254\n1204\nStem Length\n35\n35\n35\n35\nRecommended Rider Height\n5'3\"-5'7\"\n5'6\"-5'10\"\n5'9\"-6'1\"\n6'0\"-6'4\"\n*Hardtail geometry based on 30% fork sag*\nFor more information about chainstay length and our Portage Dropout System go to our\nPortage Dropout Page\nFrame Specs\nFrame Material\nCustom seamless, quadruple-butted, tapered, Drawn Over Mandrel, size-specific, ED Coated,\n4130 Chromoly\nFrame Weight\n3,300 grams or 7.28lbs for S2/MD - Weight includes Dropouts, Axle, Seat Collar, and Cable Guides\nRecomended Fork Travel\n160mm suspension fork at 30% sag (530mm A-C) - Forks within +/- 10mm approved\nHeadset Specs\nZS44 upper // EC44 lower\nRear Dropout\nEsker Portage Dropout\n- Adjustable - UDH // 148mm Hub Spacing // M12 x 1.0 x 180mm Axle\nTire Clearance\nDesigned around 29x2.6\" Accomodates up to 29x2.8\"\n*Clearance may vary based on your drivetrain choice (Chainline), rim width, actual tire measurement, and dropout position*\nSeatpost Specs\n34.9 clamp, 31.6 post, internally routed\nBottom Bracket\nThreaded 73mm BSA\nChainring Specs\nMaximum = 34t round / 32t oval\n52mm or 55mm Chainline\nSMOKEY FAQ\nQ - What size frame should I buy?\nSee the table below for a complete Esker Cycles model line-up size guide\nNOTE:\nMany folks can fit more than a single frame size. If you find yourself at a height in which you can fit 2 different frame sizes, ask yourself what your riding style is like and where/how you intend to use the bike. A larger frame will feel more stable at high speeds, but not as maneuverable in tighter and more technical situations on the trail. Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - What length dropper comes with a complete build?\nSM\n= 150mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 125mm of travel, or a 160mm Wolf Tooth Dropper that can be adjusted down to 110mm of travel.\nMD/LG/XL\n= 170mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 145mm of travel, or a 200mm Wolf Tooth Dropper that can be adjusted down to 150mm of travel.\nFor more information on the adjustability of the PNW Loam dropper, click\nHERE\n.\nFor more information on the adjustability of the Wolf Tooth dropper, click\nHERE\n.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Smokey carry?\nSM\n= 1 bottle in the front triangle, 1 bottle under the downtube.\nMD/LG/XL\n= 2 bottles in the front triangle, 1 bottle under the down tube.\nQ - Can I put a rear rack on the Smokey?\nSure Thing! While our Hayduke model has dedicated rack mounts built into the frame, the Smokey can still utilize a rear rack by installing our\nPortage Rack Mount Bolts\nand a\nSeatpost Clamp with Rack Mounts\n.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Smokey?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. Heck, we even have a single speed build option that you can buy!\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Smoky?\nTechnically, yes, but we don't offer any support on figuring out which hubs and support parts may be needed in order to make this happen. Have fun!\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not. We offer a limited menu of upgrade options for all of our bikes, but we do not do custom builds.\nIf you'd like to have a custom Esker built up, please reach out to one of our\nRetail Partners\nand they'll work with you on getting you exactly what you want!\nQ - Do your steel frames ride different than your Titanium frames?\nYes and No. Based on our own riding input, as well as a ton of great input and feedback from our customers, find that our steel frames have a very similar feel when it comes to compliance on the trail in comparison with our Titanium frames. The biggest difference that most individuals feel is the weight savings of Titanium. Our Titanium frames are around 650-900grams lighter than their steel counterparts. This weight savings results in a 'snappier' and more 'lively' riding characteristic when on the trail.\nQ - What kind of Steel do you use?\nThe Smokey is crafted from custom drawn, seamless, double butted, heat treated 4130 chromoly DOM tubeset delivering a durable yet comfortable all-mountain hardtail\nQ - What does your warranty look like?\nClick here for warranty information\nQ - Can I order one of your frames/bikes through a local bike shop?\nAbsolutely. That would be the best way to order one of our frames/bikes! Working with your local bike shop allows you to get great insight on which model is right for you, which size may work best for your intended use, and ensure that your bike gets built up and fit to your exact specifications. Jump on over to our\nDealer Locator\nto see a full map of our retail partners and find the one closest to you.\nQ - Can I demo a bike before I buy it?\nWe do our best to travel around throughout the year and often partner with regional mountain bike festivals or local retail partners to host demos. For the most up to date opportunities, check our\nDealer Locator\n.\nYou can also see a full map of our retail partners - reach out to them if you're nearby and ask them what they may have available for you to demo locally.\nQ - I want to buy a frame bag before my bike/frame arrives, can you provide the frame bag dimensions for the Smokey?\nWe don't recommend buying a frame bag until you have your frame/bike on hand. That is the absolute best way to ensure you get the right size and shape for your bike.\nIf you're looking to make a custom bag(s) for your Lorax, we've partnered with some incredible custom frame bag makers that all have our frame dimensions and files on hand.

Inversely, a smaller frame will be less stable at speeds, but allow you to pick up and place your wheels in technical sections of trail much easier.\nQ - What's the maximum tire width that the Hayduke LVS will take?\nWhile the Hayduke was designed around 29x2.6\" tires, it will fit up to tires labeled 29x3.0\" depending on your chainline, rim width, actual tire width, and dropout position.\nQ - What fork travel can I use on the Hayduke LVS?\nThe Hayduke LVS is designed around 120mm suspension forks, or a rigid fork with an Axle to Crown height of 495mm). We also test and approve the use of suspension forks within +/- 10mm of the original 120mm design.\nQ - Can I run a rigid fork on the Hayduke LVS?\nAbsolutely! Rigid Forks with an axle to crown measurement of ~495mm work best to maintain the original geometry design and ride characteristics.\nQ - How many water bottles will the Hayduke LVS carry?\nSM/MD/LG/XL\n= 2 bottles in the front triangle, 1 bottle under the down tube\nQ - How many mounting points on the frame are there for bottles, bags, racks, and other gear?\nThe Hayduke LVS also comes with 30 attachment points for adventure accessories, and M6 threaded rack mounts built into the frame for the attachment of\nMolle Rackwald\n, our proprietary direct-fit rack.\nQ - What length dropper comes with a complete build?\nSM\n= 150mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 125mm of travel.\nMD/LG/XL\n= 170mm PNW Loam dropper that can be adjusted down to 145mm of travel\nFor more information on the adjustability of the PNW Loam dropper, click\nHERE\n.\nQ - Can I single-speed the Hayduke LVS?\nYou betcha! Our\nPortage Dropout System\nallows you to adjust the chainstay length by up to 14mm, allowing you to run a single speed setup reliably, quietly, and with ease. Heck, we even have a single speed build option that you can buy!\nQ - Can I run an internally geared hub on the Hayduke LVS?\nTechnically, yes, but we recommend working with your favorite professional mechanic to figure out which hubs and support parts may be needed. Have fun!\nQ - How does the Portage Dropout System work?\nThe\nPortage Dropout System\nattaches to our hardtail frames and allows you to adjust chainstay length (for ride characteristics or tire width clearances), chain tension (for single speed application), or different hanger types (\nUDH\nor\nClassic\n).\nQ - The Size that I want is out of stock, is there anyway to get the specific one I want?\nPossibly. Shoot us an email at\ninfo@eskercycles.com\nand we'll do our best to connect you with one of our retail partners if they have one in stock.\nQ - Do you do custom builds?\nWe do not.

This tubeset provides an incredible balance of weight and strength that we find to be paramount for those big backcountry missions and covering the countless miles of abuse we've seen on our frames. We engineer this tubing specifically for this application and value Titanium's longevity both in fatigue, abrasion and corrosion resistance.\nQ - What does your warranty look like?\nEsker 1,000,000 Mile Warranty:\nYup, you read that right, we'll cover any defects in material, craftsmanship, or design up to 1,000,000 miles.
